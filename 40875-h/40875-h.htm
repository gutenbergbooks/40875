<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> present volume is somewhat in the nature
of a sequel to &ldquo;The Riddle of Personality,&rdquo;
published six years ago. In that book I reviewed
the results of modern psychological research in
the realm of the abnormal and the seemingly
supernormal, with the special purpose of making
clear their bearings on the problem of the nature
and possibilities of man. Having this special
purpose in mind, it was inadvisable to attempt
any topical and detailed treatment of the phenomena
made the subject of scientific investigation.
Such a method of treatment, no matter
how it might have added to the interest of the
book, would inevitably have obscured its message
to the reader.</p>

<p>Now, however, I have undertaken this very
thing, in the hope both of reinforcing the view
of personality set forth in the earlier work, and
of contributing something towards a wider knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of the progress science is making in the
naturalization of the supernatural, to borrow Mr.
Frank Podmore&rsquo;s happy phrase. Especially have
I tried to bring out the exceedingly practical
character of many of the discoveries made by
those scientists who, despite the often contemptuous
criticism of their colleagues, have valiantly
persisted in their adventurings in the psychical.
The world has undoubtedly been the gainer, and
richly the gainer, by their labors; and it surely
is well worth while to survey in some detail the
field they have explored and the results of their
explorations.</p>

<h1 class="f14">ADVENTURINGS IN THE<br />
PSYCHICAL</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="f8">GHOSTS AND THEIR MEANING</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A witty</span> Frenchwoman was once asked if
she believed in ghosts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; was her reply. &ldquo;But I am
terribly afraid of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most people feel precisely this way about
ghosts, though few are candid enough to acknowledge
it. In broad daylight, or when seated
before a cheery fire among a group of congenial
friends, it is easy to be skeptical, and to regard
ghosts as mere products of imagination, superstition,
credulity, hysteria, or indigestion. But
it is notorious that even the most skeptical are
liable to creepy sensations and sometimes outright
panic if they experience &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; sights or
sounds in the darkness of the night, or in lonely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
uninhabited places. Churchyards have never
been popular resorts of those who go for a stroll
in the cool of the evening. And let a house once
get the reputation of being &ldquo;haunted,&rdquo; it is next
to impossible to find tenants for it.</p>

<p>Yet this almost universal attitude is entirely
and fundamentally wrong. There is no reason
for being afraid of ghosts, and there are many
reasons for believing in them.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, mean to say that all ghosts
are real ghosts. There are plenty of bogus ghosts,
and there always will be, as long as men eat and
drink too much, play practical jokes on one another,
and allow their houses to become run down
and infested by rats and mice.</p>

<p>A single rat, scampering at midnight over the
loose planks of an old attic, has often been quite
sufficient to produce a counterfeit &ldquo;poltergeist,&rdquo;
or troublesome ghost, of a highly impressive character.
So, too, a pillow-slip swaying from a
clothesline is apt to seem most ghostly to a gentleman
returning home from a late supper. Ghosts,
like much else in this amazing world of ours, have
to be pretty sharply scrutinized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>And the point is that, after centuries of contemptuous
neglect, they have at last been made
the subject of investigation by men and women
competent for the task&mdash;persons trained in the
cautious methods of scientific inquiry, and insisting
upon the strictest evidential standards,
but devoid of prejudice or prepossession. Their
researches are still in progress, but they have
already demonstrated that amid a multitude of
sham ghosts there are perfectly authentic apparitions,
displaying credentials too convincing to be
denied.</p>

<p>What is still more important, the labors of these
scientific ghostologists&mdash;especially of those enrolled
in the famous English Society for Psychical
Research&mdash;have also resulted in throwing much
light on the nature, origin, and habits of real ghosts.</p>

<p>Usually, it seems, a genuine ghost is seen or
heard but once or twice, and then, having accomplished
its purpose, it departs to return no
more. But there are plenty of well-attested cases
in which a ghost attaches itself to a house or
family, and keeps up its haunting for years, sometimes
for centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Take, for example, an experience that befell
Miss Goodrich-Freer, at the time a most active
member of the Society for Psychical Research, in
Hampton Court Palace. This old building is
unquestionably one of the most famous of all
haunted houses. It dates back to the time of
the first Tudors, and according to tradition is
haunted by several ghosts, notably the ghosts of
Jane Seymour, Henry <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr>&rsquo;s third queen; Catharine
Howard, whose spirit is said to go shrieking
along the gallery where she vainly begged brutal
King Henry to spare her life; and Sybil Penn,
King Edward <abbr title="6">VI</abbr>&rsquo;s foster-mother. Twice of late
years the Howard ghost&mdash;or something that
passed for it&mdash;has been heard, once by Lady
Eastlake, and once by Mrs. Cavendish Boyle.
The latter was sleeping in an apartment next to
the haunted gallery&mdash;which has long been unoccupied
and used only as a storeroom for old
pictures&mdash;when she was suddenly awakened by
a loud and most unearthly shriek proceeding
from that quarter, followed immediately by perfect
silence. Lady Eastlake&rsquo;s experience was
exactly similar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Both ladies, of course, may have heard a real
shriek, possibly coming from some nightmare-tormented
occupant of the palace. But no explanation
of this sort is adequate in the case of
Miss Goodrich-Freer, who passed a night at
Hampton Court for the sole purpose of ascertaining
whether or not there was any foundation for
its ghostly legends.</p>

<p>The room she selected for her vigil was one
especially reputed to be haunted, and opened into
a second room, the door between the two, however,
being blocked by a heavy piece of furniture.
Thus the only means of entrance into her room
was by a door from the corridor, and this she
locked and bolted. After which, feeling confident
that nothing but a real ghost could get in to
trouble her, she settled down to read an essay on
&ldquo;Shall We Degrade Our Standard of Value?&rdquo;
a subject manifestly free from matters likely to
occasion nervousness.</p>

<p>In fact, the essay was so dull that by half past
one Miss Goodrich-Freer, not able to keep awake
longer, undressed, dropped into bed, and was
almost instantly asleep. Several hours later she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was aroused by a noise as of some one opening
the furniture-barricaded door. At this she put
out her hand to reach a match-box which she
knew was lying on a table at the head of the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not reach the matches,&rdquo; she reports.
&ldquo;It seemed to me that a detaining hand was laid
on mine. I withdrew it quickly and gazed around
into the darkness. Some minutes passed in blackness
and silence. I had the sensation of a presence
in the room, and finally, mindful of the tradition
that a ghost should be spoken to, I said gently:
&lsquo;Is any one there? Can I do anything for you?&rsquo;
I remembered that the last person who entertained
the ghost had said: &lsquo;Go away, I don&rsquo;t
want you,&rsquo; and I hoped that my visitor would
admire my better manners and be responsive.
However, there was no answer, no sound of any
kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Miss Goodrich-Freer left the bed and felt
all around the room in the dark, until satisfied
that she was alone. The corridor door was still
locked and bolted; the piece of furniture against
the inner door was in place. So she returned to
bed. Almost at once a soft light began to glow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
with increasing brightness. It seemed to radiate
from a central point, which gradually took form
and became a tall, slender woman, moving slowly
across the room. At the foot of the bed she
stopped, so that the amazed observer had time to
examine her profile and general appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her face,&rdquo; Miss Goodrich-Freer says, &ldquo;was
insipidly pretty, that of a woman from thirty to
thirty-five years of age, her figure slight, her dress
of a soft, dark material, having a full skirt and
broad sash or soft waistband tied high up almost
under her arms, a crossed or draped handkerchief
over the shoulders and sleeves which I noticed
fitted very tight below the elbow. In spite of all
this definiteness I was conscious that the figure
was unsubstantial, and felt quite guilty of absurdity
in asking once more: &lsquo;Will you let me
help you? Can I be of any use to you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My voice sounded preternaturally loud, but
I felt no surprise at noticing that it produced no
effect upon my visitor. She stood still for perhaps
two minutes, though it is very difficult to estimate
time on such occasions. Then she raised her
hands, which were long and white, and held them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
before her as she sank upon her knees and slowly
buried her face in the palms in an attitude of
prayer&mdash;when quite suddenly the light went
out, and I was alone in the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt that the scene was ended, the curtain
drawn, and had no hesitation in lighting the candle
at my side.... The clock struck four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again investigation showed that the corridor
door was locked and bolted as she had left it, and
the inner door still firmly barricaded. Consequently,
skeptical though she had been when
she arrived at Hampton Court Palace, Miss Goodrich-Freer
in leaving it entertained no doubt that
she had witnessed a genuine psychical manifestation.</p>

<p>The same conclusion was forced upon two
ladies, Miss Elizabeth Morison and Miss Frances
Lamont, in connection with a visit paid by them
to another famous haunted house, the Petit
Trianon at Versailles, the favorite summer home
of that unfortunate queen Marie Antoinette,
whose ghost, as well as the ghosts of her attendants,
has long been alleged to be visible at times
in and around it. Miss Morison and Miss Lamont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had been sightseeing in the royal palace, but
tiring of this had set off, in the early afternoon,
to walk to the Trianon. Neither of them knew
just where it was located, but taking the general
direction indicated on Baedeker&rsquo;s map, they
finally came to a broad drive, which, had they
only known it, would have led them directly to
their destination. As it was, they crossed the
drive and went up a narrow lane through a thick
wood to a point where three paths diverged. Here
they began to have a series of experiences which,
comparatively insignificant in themselves, had a
sequel so amazing that it would be incredible
were it not that the veracity of both ladies has
been established beyond question.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Ahead of them, on the middle path, they saw
two men clad in curious, old-fashioned costumes
of long, greenish coats, knee breeches, and small,
three-cornered hats. Taking them for gardeners,
they asked to be shown the way, and were told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to go straight ahead. This brought them to a
little clearing that had in it a light garden kiosk,
circular and like a bandstand, near which a man
was seated. As they approached, he turned his
head and stared at them, and his expression was
so repellent that they felt greatly frightened.
The next instant, coming from they knew not
where, and breathless as if from running, a second
man appeared, and speaking in French of a peculiar
accent, ordered them brusquely to turn to
the right, saying that the Trianon lay in that
direction. Just as they reached it, they were
again intercepted, this time by a young man who
stepped out of a rear door, banged it behind him,
and with a somewhat insolent air guided them to
the main entrance of the palace.</p>

<p>While they were hurrying thither, Miss Morison
noticed a lady, seated below a terrace, holding
out a paper as though reading at arm&rsquo;s length.
She glanced up as they passed, and Miss Morison,
observing with surprise the peculiar cut of her
gown, saw that she had a pretty &ldquo;though not
young&rdquo; face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked straight at her,&rdquo; she adds in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
published statement she has made regarding their
adventure, &ldquo;but some indescribable feeling made
me turn away, disturbed at her being there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Afterwards this &ldquo;indescribable feeling&rdquo; was
accounted for when Miss Morison identified in a
rare portrait of Marie Antoinette the lady she
had seen seated below the terrace!</p>

<p>Still more remarkable, subsequent visits to the
Trianon brought to both ladies the startling
knowledge that the actual surroundings of the
place and the place itself differ vastly from what
they saw that summer afternoon. The woods
they entered are not there, and have not been
there in the memory of man; the paths they trod
have long been effaced; there is no kiosk, nor does
anybody living, except Miss Morison and Miss
Lamont, remember having seen one in the Trianon
grounds; on the very spot where Miss Morison
saw the lady in the peculiar dress a large bush
is growing; and the rear door, out of which
stepped the young man who guided them around
to the front, opens from an old chapel that has
been in a ruinous condition for many years, the
door itself being &ldquo;bolted, barred, and cobwebbed,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and unused since the time of Marie
Antoinette.</p>

<p>On the other hand, their personal researches in
the archives of France have brought to light so
many confirmatory facts that both Miss Morison
and Miss Lamont are firmly persuaded that the
Trianon, its environment, and its people were
once exactly as they appeared to them; and that
in very truth they saw the place as it looked, not
at the time they first visited it, but in the closing
years of the French Monarchy, more than a century
before.</p>

<p>That historic German ghost, the White Lady of
the Hohenzollerns, would likewise seem to have
more than a legendary basis. Her mission, apparently,
is to announce the death of some member
of the Hohenzollern family, and her most
frequent haunting-place is the royal palace at
Berlin. She was seen as early as 1628, and since
the time of Frederick the Great her appearance
has been regularly chronicled on the eve of the
death of the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>For the matter of that, there are not a few
families whose ancestral homes, according to tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
are haunted by death-announcing ghosts.
This is particularly the case with certain distinguished
British families. Two white owls perching
on the roof of the family mansion are taken as a
sure omen of death in the Arundel of Wardour
family. The Yorkshire Middletons, a Catholic
family, are said to be warned of approaching death
by the apparition of a Benedictine nun. Equally
noteworthy as a spectral messenger of tragedy
is the so-called Drummer of Cortachy Castle, a
Scottish ghost that haunts the ancient stronghold
of the Ogilvys, Earls of Airlie, but is in evidence
only when an Ogilvy is about to die.</p>

<p>The story goes that, hundreds of years ago,
when the Scots were little better than barbarians,
a Highland chieftain sent a drummer to Cortachy
Castle with a message that was not at all to the
liking of the Ogilvy of that time. As an appropriate
token of his displeasure, he seized the
luckless drummer, stuffed him into his drum&mdash;he
must have been a very small drummer, and
have carried a very big drum&mdash;and hurled him
from the topmost battlements of the castle, breaking
his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before he was tossed off, the drummer
threatened to make a ghost of himself, and haunt
the Ogilvys forevermore. He has been, it would
seem, as good as his word. Every once in a while
ghostly drumming is heard at Cortachy Castle,
and always the death of an Ogilvy follows. An
especially impressive account of one instance of
this peculiar and most unpleasant haunting has
been left by a Miss Dalrymple, who happened to
be a guest at Cortachy during Christmas week of
1844.</p>

<p>It was her first visit to the Castle, and she was
entirely unaware of the existence of the family
ghost. On the evening of her arrival, while dressing
for dinner, she was startled by hearing under
her window music like the muffled beating of a
drum. She looked out, but could see nothing, and
presently the drumming died away. For the time
she thought no more of it, but at dinner she
turned to her host, the Earl of Airlie, and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, who is your drummer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His lordship made no reply, Lady Airlie became
exceedingly pale, and several of the company,
all of whom had heard the question, looked embarrassed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Realizing that she had made a slip
of some sort, Miss Dalrymple quickly changed the
subject, but after dinner, naturally feeling somewhat
curious, she brought it up with one of the
younger members of the family, and was answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Have you never heard of the Drummer
of Cortachy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Who in the world is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he is a person who goes about playing
his drum whenever there is a death impending
in our family. The last time he was heard was
shortly before the death of the late countess, the
earl&rsquo;s first wife, and that is why Lady Airlie turned
so pale when you mentioned it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next night Miss Dalrymple heard the
drumming again, and, falling into a panic when
she learned that nobody else had heard it, hurriedly
left Cortachy Castle. But the drumming
was not for her. True to tradition, the drummer
was concerned only with announcing the death of
an Ogilvy, one of whom, the Lady Airlie who had
been so disturbed by Miss Dalrymple&rsquo;s question,
died soon afterward while on a visit to Brighton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Five years later the drumming was once more
heard, this time by an Englishman who had been
invited to spend a few days with the Earl of
Airlie&rsquo;s oldest son, Lord Ogilvy, at a shooting
box near Cortachy. Crossing a gloomy moor,
in company with an old Highlander, the Englishman
suddenly stopped, and, with a look of amazement,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can a band be doing in this lonely
place? Has Lord Ogilvy brought a band with
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Highlander glanced at him strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear naething,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, can&rsquo;t you hear it? A band playing
in the distance&mdash;or at any rate, somebody playing
a drum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; is it a drum ye hear?&rdquo; cried the Highlander.
&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis something no canny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another moment the lighted windows of the
shooting box came into view, and the Englishman
hastened forward, fully expecting to have
the mystery solved. But he found no musicians&mdash;only
a scene of considerable confusion. Lord
Ogilvy, it appeared, had just started for London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
summoned by news that his father was dangerously
ill.</p>

<p>And the very next day, as the Englishman&rsquo;s
Highlander guide was not at all surprised to
learn, the Earl of Airlie died.</p>

<p>Of all family ghosts, however, none is so strongly
substantiated by documentary<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> evidence as the
Knocking Ghost of the Basil Woodds, an old
English family. This ghost began operations
about the time of the Stuart Restoration, and it
is alleged has ever since continued to announce,
by three or more loud knocks, the approaching
death of a Basil Woodd. First-hand and thoroughly
trustworthy accounts are extant of its
activity in quite recent times.</p>

<p>December 15, 1893, Mr. Charles H.&nbsp;L. Woodd
died at Hampstead, England, after a brief illness.
The night before he died the Knocking Ghost
was heard by two persons, at Hampstead by his
daughter, and in London by his son, the Reverend
Trevor Basil Woodd. Both have made statements
describing their singular experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On Thursday evening, December 14, 1893,
after church,&rdquo; says the Reverend Mr. Woodd,
&ldquo;I was sitting before my fire. I knew my father
was ill, and had a presentiment that he was
dangerously ill, though if I had known this I
should have remained at Hampstead, where I
had been that day. As I sat, I distinctly heard
three knocks, perhaps more, like the sound of
some one emptying a tobacco pipe upon the bars
of my fire grate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinking it might be a warning, I did not go
to bed for an hour, fearing I would be sent for.
At one <span class="f8">A.&nbsp;M.</span> I was awakened by a ringing of the
front door-bell and knocking. It was my father&rsquo;s
butler, who told me the doctor had sent for me,
as my father was very ill. I said to my housekeeper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must go. I feel sure that my father is
dying, because I heard the Woodd knocks, as I
sat in my chair before going to bed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my arrival my first question was: &lsquo;Is he
still alive?&rsquo; for I believed he must have passed
away at the time of the knocking. He died at
eight-forty-five next morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Woodd&rsquo;s housekeeper corroborates this
statement. As to the knocking heard at Hampstead,
the daughter, Mrs. Winifred Dumbell,
testifies:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On December 14, 1893, Thursday morning,
hearing my father, Mr. Charles Woodd, was not
well, I left Epsom, where I had been staying, for
Hampstead, and found my father in bed and
very weak, but I was in no way anxious about
him, as I did not suppose him to be seriously ill.
At eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, being tired and finding
I could not assist my mother or the nurse, I lay
down in an adjoining room, leaving the door
wide open, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a short time I was suddenly awakened by
a loud rapping as if at the door. I jumped up
and ran into the passage, thinking my mother
had called me. I listened at the door of my father&rsquo;s
room, but no one was moving. I lay down again
and instantly fell asleep, when exactly the same
thing occurred. I did not actually sleep again,
and cannot say whether any sound made me get
up the third time, but I went in search of the
doctor and gathered that he was anxious about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
my father, who was getting much weaker. We
were all aroused, and about eight o&rsquo;clock <span class="f8">A.&nbsp;M.</span> my
father died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not connect this rapping with the
Woodd warning, as all was so sudden and unexpected,
but on mentioning it at breakfast the
next morning to my brother, the Reverend Trevor
Basil Woodd, he told me he also heard a similar
warning in his rooms at Vauxhall Bridge Road
about the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To mention only one other of the many instances
that might be cited, the Knocking Ghost
was again heard on June 3, 1895, just twenty-four
hours before the death of Mr. Thomas Basil
Woodd at Hampstead. Again, too, it was heard
by more than one person and in more than one
place, by Mr. Woodd&rsquo;s daughters, Fanny and
Kate, and by his niece, Miss Ethel G. Woodd,
who was at the time visiting friends in Yorkshire,
and at first mistook the Knocking Ghost for
somebody hammering nails into the wall of the
next room. Oddly enough, this was also the way
it sounded to Fanny Woodd, in London, as appears
from the following statement signed by her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On June 3, 1895, at ten-thirty <span class="f8">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, Fanny
Woodd, staying with Mrs. Stoney, 83 Wharton
Road, West Kensington, heard knocks, apparently
from next door, as of nails being hammered
in and pictures hung, which seemed so unlikely
at that hour of night that the next morning she
mentioned it to Mrs. Stoney, whose bedroom was
just below hers, asking if she had heard it or
could account for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Stoney had heard nothing, and the
next-door neighbor, Mrs. Harriet Taylor, rather
tartly declared that: &ldquo;There has been no putting
up of pictures or knocking of any sort
in this house for quite two years. We are
also early risers, and are always in bed and
asleep by ten <span class="f8">P.&nbsp;M.</span>&rdquo; That same day Miss
Woodd rejoined her father and sister in Hampstead,
and was astonished to hear that the latter
had been awakened about half past ten the previous
night by loud knockings against the window
shutters.</p>

<p>A few hours more and the mystery was solved
by the startlingly sudden death of Mr. Woodd,
from an attack of apoplexy. The Knocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Ghost of the Basil Woodds had lived up to its
reputation.</p>

<p>The giving of death warnings is by no means
confined to family ghosts, as may be sufficiently
indicated by relating an incident that happened
in Canada some years ago, and that has always
impressed me as one of the best ghost stories I
have ever heard. It was told me by an actor in
the strange little drama, and knowing as I do
the persons concerned, I have not the slightest
hesitation in vouching for its authenticity, incredible
though the reader may be inclined to
regard it.</p>

<p>In this instance the ghost was seen by a clergyman,
the Reverend John Langtry, who afterward
became a prominent dignitary of the English
Church in Canada. His home was in Toronto,
but on the occasion of the ghostly visitation he
was at the house of a Mr. and Mrs. Ruttan, who
lived with their only child, a young girl, in
a small town some fifty or sixty miles north of
Toronto. Mr. Ruttan was another Church of
England clergyman, and was a warm friend of
Doctor Langtry&rsquo;s. This time, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
latter had journeyed to see him simply on a matter
of diocesan business, and was anxious to
complete it and get back to Toronto.</p>

<p>To his disappointment he found that Mr.
Ruttan had been called out of town, and would
not be home until a late hour, possibly not until
the following day. On the chance that he might
return earlier than expected, Doctor Langtry
accepted Mrs. Ruttan&rsquo;s invitation to spend the
evening with her.</p>

<p>As they were chatting together&mdash;she being so
seated that her back was toward the door leading
from the parlor, whereas Doctor Langtry&rsquo;s position
gave him a full view of the hall&mdash;she noticed
that all at once he stopped in the middle of a
sentence, leaned forward, and stared fixedly into
the hall. She instantly turned her head, and
followed the direction of his gaze, but could see
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Doctor Langtry?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; he muttered, recovering
himself with an effort. &ldquo;I fancied for a moment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused, then changed the conversation.
But Mrs. Ruttan&mdash;from whom I got the story&mdash;saw
that from time to time he glanced furtively
into the hall, and finally half rose from his seat,
his face white, his limbs trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Langtry!&rdquo; was her startled exclamation.
&ldquo;Are you ill? Whatever is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said shortly, &ldquo;it is only a momentary
faintness. I shall be all right presently. The
fatigue of the journey must have unstrung me. I
will trouble you to get me a glass of water, and
then I think I will return to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drank the water, and rose to go. But when
near the front door, he turned to Mrs. Ruttan,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I have asked after your
daughter. I trust she is well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is quite well, thank you. I put her to
bed just before you came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his hand on the knob of the door, Doctor
Langtry again paused irresolutely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not too much trouble,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;I
wish you would go up-stairs and make sure she
is all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Wondering at his request and at his manner,
Mrs. Ruttan complied, and presently returned to
report that the child was sleeping peacefully.
Doctor Langtry bowed with an air of obvious
relief, bade her good night, and left the house.
But next day, after he had transacted his business,
and was about to start for Toronto, he said to
Mr. Ruttan, who had accompanied him to the
train:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruttan, if your little girl should happen to
fall ill while away from home, go to her at once,
and take Mrs. Ruttan with you, even if you have
no reason to feel that the illness is serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ruttan laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we would go to her. You may be
sure of that. But why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask me no questions,&rdquo; said Doctor Langtry,
&ldquo;but bear my request in mind if the occasion
should arise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within a very short time the child, visiting an
aunt in a near-by town, was taken ill, failed
rapidly, and died almost before her parents, who
had been hastily telegraphed for, could reach her
bedside. Doctor Langtry&rsquo;s warning immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
recurred to them, and they wrote him, beseeching
an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reason I was anxious about your little
girl,&rdquo; he then told them, &ldquo;was because the night
I was sitting with Mrs. Ruttan I saw an angel
enter the hall, pass up the stairs, and return,
carrying the child in its arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the kind of ghost most frequently seen is
that which appears not before but immediately
after, or coincidental with, a death. Its purpose
is not to give warning of impending tragedy, but
to convey the news of a tragedy already consummated.
There are thousands of instances of this
sort, so well authenticated as to compel credence.
Not long ago an interesting case was reported to
me by a gentleman living in Burlington, Vermont,
the nephew of the lady&mdash;a Mrs. Hazard of Newport,
Rhode Island&mdash;who saw the ghost.</p>

<p>She was ill at the time, and under the care of
a trained nurse. One afternoon, her physician
having allowed her to sit up for a couple of hours,
she was seated in a chair by the side of her bed,
when the nurse noticed her open wide her eyes
and turn her head as if following the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of some one. Then she heard her say, in a tone of
surprise:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hello! There he goes! There he
goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As far as the nurse could see, nobody was in
the room with them. But, not wishing to alarm
her patient, she merely asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it, Mrs. Hazard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chet Keech. But he doesn&rsquo;t see me. And
now he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later in the day the nurse mentioned the incident
to Mrs. Hazard&rsquo;s daughter, asking her if
she knew anybody by the name of Chet Keech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly I do,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He
is my cousin, and lives in Danielson, Connecticut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That day Chet Keech had died at Danielson,
as a letter informed the Hazards next morning.</p>

<p>Consider also this statement<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by the Reverend
C.&nbsp;C. McKechnie, a Scotch clergyman:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about ten years of age at the time, and
had for several years been living with my grandfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
who was an elder in the Kirk of Scotland
and in good circumstances. He was very much
attached to me and often expressed his intention
of having me educated for a minister in the Kirk.
Suddenly, however, he was seized with an illness
which in a couple of days proved mortal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time of his death, and without my
having any apprehension of his end, I happened
to be at my father&rsquo;s house, about a mile off. I
was leaning in a listless sort of way against the
kitchen table, looking upward at the ceiling and
thinking of nothing in particular, when my grandfather&rsquo;s
face appeared to grow out of the ceiling,
at first dim and indistinct, but becoming more
and more complete until it seemed in every respect
as full and perfect as I had ever seen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looked down upon me, as I thought, with
a wonderful expression of tenderness and affection.
Then it disappeared, not suddenly but
gradually, its features fading and becoming dim
and indistinct, until I saw nothing but the bare
ceiling. I spoke at the time of what I saw to my
mother, but she made no account of it, thinking,
probably, it was nothing more than a boyish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
vagary. But in about fifteen or twenty minutes
after seeing the vision, a boy came running breathless
to my father&rsquo;s with the news that my grandfather
had just died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even more remarkable was the experience of
an Illinois physician, Doctor J.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. Entwistle,
a resident of one of the Chicago suburbs. Hurrying
one morning to catch a train Doctor Entwistle
saw approaching him an acquaintance, once well-to-do,
who had ruined himself by drink. Glancing
at him as they met, the physician noticed
that his clothing was torn and his face bruised,
and that there was a cut under one eye. He
noticed, too, that the other kept looking steadily
at him with a &ldquo;woe-begone, God-forsaken expression.&rdquo;
Had he not been in such a hurry, he
would have stopped and spoken to him, but as it
was he passed him with a nod.</p>

<p>At the station Doctor Entwistle met his
brother-in-law, and said, while the train was
drawing in:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, I just saw Charlie M., and
he was a sight. He must have been on a terrible
tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s doing in town, anyway?&rdquo;
commented the brother-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he was going to see his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. She won&rsquo;t have him around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the subject was dropped, and nothing
more was said about it until after they had reached
Chicago. Both men, as it happened, had business
at the Grand Pacific Hotel and went directly
there from the train. They were met by a mutual
friend, who had a copy of the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite> in
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he greeted them. &ldquo;Did you know
that Charlie M. is dead? Here is a notice in the
paper, stating that his body is at the morgue. He
was killed in a saloon fight. The paper hasn&rsquo;t
got the name quite right, but from the description
it&rsquo;s Charlie, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t be dead,&rdquo; said Doctor Entwistle,
aghast, &ldquo;for it was only a few minutes ago that
I met him on the street in Englewood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it turned out that Charlie M. <em>was</em>
dead, and that his body had been taken to the
morgue several hours before Doctor Entwistle
thought he saw him in the Chicago suburb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Moreover, on inquiry it was learned that the
clothes worn by him when he was killed and the
marks on his face &ldquo;tallied in every particular
with the description given by the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite a similar experience occurred to Mr.
Harry E. Reeves when he was choirmaster at
St. Luke&rsquo;s Church in San Francisco. On a Friday,
about three in the afternoon, Mr. Reeves was in
an up-stairs room at his home. He had been
working on some music. Wishing to rest for a
few minutes, he threw himself on a lounge, but
almost immediately an unaccountable impulse
led him to get up again and open the door of his
room.</p>

<p>Standing at the head of the stairs he saw Edwin
Russell, a member of his choir and a well-known
San Francisco real estate broker. Mr. Russell
had promised to call on him the following day to
look over the music for Sunday, and Mr. Reeves&rsquo;s
first thought was that he had come a day earlier
than intended. He advanced to greet him, when,
to his amazement and horror, the figure on the
stairs turned as though to descend, and then
faded into nothingness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; gasped Reeves, and fell forward.</p>

<p>A door below was hastily opened, and two
women and a man ran to his aid. The women
were his sister and niece, the man was a Mr.
Sprague. They found Mr. Reeves seated on the
stairs, his face white and covered with perspiration,
his body trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Harry!&rdquo; cried the niece. &ldquo;What in
the world is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Reeves was in such a panic that he could
hardly speak, but he managed to reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen a ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose ghost?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sprague, with
a skeptical smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost of Edwin Russell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the smile left Mr. Sprague&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very strange.
For, as these ladies will tell you, I came to consult
with you regarding the music for Mr. Russell&rsquo;s
funeral. He had a stroke of apoplexy this morning,
and died a few hours ago.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes ghosts of this type present themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in such a way as to leave no doubt as to the
fact and manner of the death of the person seen.
As striking a case in point as has come to my
knowledge is afforded by the singular experience
of an old friend of mine, Edward Jackson, son
of the late General Jackson, of Bideford, England.</p>

<p>Born in India, Jackson was from his boyhood
of a roving and adventurous disposition. He
went in for all forms of athletics, more particularly
boxing, cricket, and polo, and before he left
India was one of the best known and most popular
men in the younger sporting set.</p>

<p>He was still in his early twenties when he came
to the United States, drifting West to go on a
ranch in Wyoming. Tiring of this, though not
of his fondness for adventure, he found work in a
Lake Superior mine, where his quickly demonstrated
ability to take care of himself in a rough-and-tumble
encounter won him the position of
superintendent over a gang of men whom it had
hitherto been most difficult to superintend.</p>

<p>As superintendent he was privileged to live by
himself in a small, two-room cabin, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
neater and more comfortable than the ordinary
sleeping-shacks. It was in this cabin that he saw
the ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had returned from the mine one evening,
thoroughly tired out,&rdquo; he said, in telling me the
story, &ldquo;and sat down to rest for a few minutes
before an open fire. While I was sitting there,
half dozing, I felt a cold current of air, and looked
up, thinking that somebody had thrown the door
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The door was not open, but standing between
me and it was the figure of a young man whom I
instantly recognized as a boyhood chum in India.
He was dressed in polo costume&mdash;we had often
played the game together&mdash;but for a moment I
forgot all about the incongruity between his dress
and the rough, outlandish place in which I then
saw him. I jumped up, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Jove, Jack, I&rsquo;m glad to see you. When
did you get here? And how&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stopped. He had been standing with his
profile toward me. Now he turned, facing me,
and I saw that he was ghastly white, with a deep
cut over one eye. Without a word he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
past me, gazing at me solemnly, and disappeared
in the inner room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am a coward, but I confess
that for a moment I felt faint. Recovering, and
believing that somebody must be playing me a
trick, I made a dash after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no one there&mdash;and no way in
which anybody could have got out unknown to
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night I wrote to my father, telling him
what had happened. In his reply he informed me
that my friend had been killed the same day that
I saw him in my cabin on the shore of Lake Superior.
He had been playing polo in far-away
India, had been thrown from his horse, and had
struck on his head, sustaining a wound similar
to that I had seen in my vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of a somewhat different order, and at once
recalling to mind the adventure of Miss Morison
and Miss Lamont at the Petit Trianon, is an instance
reported by an Englishwoman whose name
must be withheld, for reasons that will become
obvious. With her husband she had recently
moved into a fine old mansion surrounded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
splendid park, with a broad stretch of lawn between
the trees and the house. The place had
for many years been the home of a family of
ancient lineage.</p>

<p>One night, shortly after eleven o&rsquo;clock, when
Mrs. M., as I shall call her, had gone to her bedroom,
she thought she heard a moaning sound,
and some one sobbing as though in great distress.
Mr. M. was away from home, the servants
slept in another part of the house, and she was
quite alone except for a friend who had come to
keep her company during her husband&rsquo;s absence,
and to whom she had said good night a few minutes
before. But being a courageous woman, she
resolved to make an investigation and soon located
the sound as coming from outdoors. Tiptoeing
over to a window on the staircase landing,
she raised the blind and cautiously peered out.</p>

<p>Below, on the lawn, in the pale glow of the
moon, she saw an amazing scene. A middle-aged
man, stern of face and wearing a general&rsquo;s uniform,
was standing menacingly over a young girl,
who, with hands clasped in anguish, was on her
knees before him. At the sight of his hard, unrelenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
expression, Mrs. M.&rsquo;s one thought was
not of fear for herself but pity for the unfortunate
girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much did I feel for her,&rdquo; she said, in narrating
the affair, &ldquo;that without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation I ran down the staircase to the door
opening upon the lawn to beg her to come in and
tell me her sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she reached the door, the figures of the
soldier and the girl were still plainly visible on the
lawn, and in precisely the same attitude. But
at the sound of her voice they disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did not vanish instantly,&rdquo; Mrs. M. explained,
&ldquo;but more like a dissolving view&mdash;that
is, gradually. And I did not leave the door until
they had gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Months afterwards, when calling with her
husband at a neighboring house, she noticed on
the wall the portrait of a distinguished-looking
man in a military uniform. At once she recognized
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she told her husband, in an undertone,
&ldquo;is a picture of the officer I saw on the lawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aloud she asked: &ldquo;Whose portrait is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied her host, &ldquo;it is a portrait of
my uncle, General Sir X.&nbsp;Y. He was born and
died in the house you now occupy. But why do
you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she had told the story, her host commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you say is most singular. For it is an
unhappy fact that Sir X.&nbsp;Y.&rsquo;s youngest daughter,
a beautiful girl, brought disgrace upon the
family, was disowned and driven from home by
her father, and died broken-hearted.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Not all ghosts, it is pleasant to know, bring
notification of impending or already consummated
tragedy. Many seem to exist solely for
the purpose of giving a warning of trouble which
may be averted by taking proper precautions,
and sometimes they are a direct means of preventing
disaster. Thus, a guest at a Back Bay hotel
in Boston was hurrying along a dimly lighted
corridor to catch an elevator she thought she
saw waiting for her, when unexpectedly the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of a man appeared at the entrance to the elevator.
She was almost upon him, and stopped short in
order to avoid a collision. At once he disappeared,
and she then saw that although the door in the
elevator shaft was wide open, the car was at the
bottom of the shaft, into which she certainly
would have fallen had not the phantasmal figure
checked her onward rush.</p>

<p>Or take this instance, reported by Lady Eardley:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day I went to my bathroom, locked the
door, undressed, and was just about to get into
the bath, when I heard a voice say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unlock the door!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was startled and looked around, but of
course no one was there. I had stepped into the
bath when I heard the voice twice more, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unlock the door!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this I jumped out and did unlock the door,
and then stepped into the bath again. As I got
in I fainted away and fell down flat in the water.
Fortunately, as I fell, I was just able to catch at
a bell handle, which was attached to the wall
above the tub. My pull brought the maid, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
found me, she said, lying with my head under
water. She picked me up and carried me out.
If the door had been locked I would certainly
have been drowned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still more impressive is an experience in the
life of an Englishwoman named Mrs. Jean Gwynne
Bettany. Her statement is corroborated by her
father and mother.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;On one occasion,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I was walking
in a country lane. I was reading geometry as
I walked along, a subject little likely to produce
fancies or morbid phenomena of any kind, when,
in a moment, I saw a bedroom in my house known
as the &lsquo;White Room,&rsquo; and upon the floor lay my
mother, to all appearance dead. The vision must
have remained some minutes, during which time
my real surroundings appeared to pale and die
out; but as the vision faded, actual surroundings
came back, at first dimly, and then clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not doubt that what I had seen was
real, so, instead of going home, I went at once to
the house of our medical man, and he immediately
set out with me, on the way putting questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
I could not answer, as my mother was to
all appearance well when I left home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I led the doctor straight to the &lsquo;White Room,&rsquo;
where we found my mother actually lying as in
my vision. This was true even to minute details.
She had been seized suddenly by an attack at the
heart, and would soon have breathed her last but
for the doctor&rsquo;s timely advent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bettany&rsquo;s father, Mr. S.&nbsp;G. Gwynne,
adds:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I distinctly remember being surprised by
seeing my daughter, in company with the family
doctor, outside the door of my residence; and I
asked: &lsquo;Who is ill?&rsquo; She replied: &lsquo;Mamma.&rsquo;
She led the way at once to the &lsquo;White Room,&rsquo;
where we found my wife lying in a swoon on the
floor. It was when I asked when she had been
taken ill that I found it must have been after
my daughter had left the house. None of the
servants in the house knew anything of the sudden
illness, which our doctor assured me would
have been fatal had he not arrived when he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this last case, it should be noted the ghost
seen was an apparition not of a dead person, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of a living one. This is most important, from the
point of view of gaining insight into the nature
and characteristics of ghosts.</p>

<p>The investigators who, a matter of twenty-five
or thirty years ago, began for the first time to
inquire into the subject in a scientific way, early
made the interesting discovery that phantasms
of the living are seen quite as frequently as phantasms
of the dead. Besides which, it was found
that ghosts could be produced experimentally&mdash;that
by a mere act of willing, one person could
make another, sometimes miles distant, see a
ghost. Many successful experiments of the kind,
supported by ample corroborative evidence, are
now on record. For example:</p>

<p>Mr. B.&nbsp;F. Sinclair, at the time a resident of
Lakewood, New Jersey, had occasion to go to
New York to be absent several days. His wife
was not feeling well when he left home, and he
was greatly worried about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night,&rdquo; to continue the narrative<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
own words, &ldquo;before I went to bed, I thought
I would try to find out, if possible, her condition.
I had undressed, and was sitting on the edge of
the bed, when I covered my face with my hands
and willed myself in Lakewood at home, to see
if I could see her. After a little, I seemed to be
standing in her room before the bed, and saw
her lying there, looking much better. I felt
satisfied she was better, and so spent the week
more comfortably regarding her condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Saturday I went home. When she saw
me, she remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought something had surely happened
to you. I saw you standing in front of the bed
the night you left, as plain as could be, and I have
been worrying about you ever since.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After explaining my effort to find out her
condition, everything became clear to her. She
had seen me when I was trying to see her. I
thought at the time I was going to see her and
make her see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In at least one instance another experimenter,
a German savant named Wesermann, performed
the seemingly impossible feat of creating, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
simple act of volition, a ghost not of himself but
of a person who was dead.</p>

<p>Herr Wesermann had been greatly troubled by
the conduct of a friend, a young officer in the
German army, and in the hope of reforming him,
&ldquo;willed&rdquo; one evening that at eleven o&rsquo;clock that
night he should see in a dream an apparition of a
lady in whom he had once been greatly interested,
but who had been dead five years.</p>

<p>It chanced that at eleven o&rsquo;clock, instead of
being in bed and asleep, Herr Wesermann&rsquo;s friend
was chatting with a brother officer. Nevertheless,
the apparition came to him at the hour appointed,
and was seen, not only by him, but by his companion
also.</p>

<p>The door of his chamber seemed to open, and
the ghost of his dead sweetheart walked in,
&ldquo;dressed in white, with black kerchief and bared
head.&rdquo; Both officers started to their feet, and
watched with bulging eyes while the ghost bowed
gravely to them, turned, and without a word disappeared.</p>

<p>They followed instantly, rushing into the corridor,
but saw only the sentry, who solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
assured them that nobody but themselves had
entered or left the room.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Facts like these naturally raised in the minds
of many of the investigators a belief that quite
possibly ghosts could be explained without resorting
to the alternative of dogmatically denying
their reality or regarding them as supernatural
beings. This belief was strengthened by other
facts brought to light in the course of experiments
to determine the actuality of telepathy, or thought
transference as it used to be called.</p>

<p>It was discovered that, under certain favoring
conditions, thoughts could indeed be transmitted
from mind to mind without passing through the
ordinary known channels of communication; and
furthermore that thoughts thus transmitted were
often apprehended, not as mere ideas, but in the
form of auditory or visual hallucinations.</p>

<p>Thus, if it were a question of &ldquo;telepathing&rdquo;
the idea of a certain playing card, say the three
of diamonds, the recipient, instead of simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
getting the thought, &ldquo;three of diamonds,&rdquo; might
hear an hallucinatory voice saying to him, &ldquo;three
of diamonds,&rdquo; or might see three diamond-shaped
objects floating before his eyes, the &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; of
three diamonds, so to speak.</p>

<p>Of even greater significance was the discovery
that it frequently happened also that instead of
getting the message which the experimenter had
consciously attempted to send, the recipient
would get other ideas merely latent in the experimenter&rsquo;s
mind&mdash;ideas connected with his environment,
something he had been doing, etc. Or the
recipient might get the right message several
hours after the experiment had been made&mdash;receiving
it, for example, in a dream.</p>

<p>The obvious conclusion was that telepathy
must be a function not of a person&rsquo;s ordinary
consciousness, but of what psychologists call the
subconsciousness, thus accounting for the difficulty
of invariably obtaining satisfactory results
in telepathic experiments.</p>

<p>In the light of these discoveries, then, the belief
has been gaining ground that ghosts&mdash;real
ghosts&mdash;are at most nothing but mental images<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
impressed upon one mind by another through the
subtle power of telepathy, and apprehended in
the form of hallucinations of the various senses,
just as any ordinary telepathic message may be
apprehended.</p>

<p>A person is stricken with a mortal illness, is
fatally injured, or is passing through some other
great crisis likely to terminate in death. Consciously
or subconsciously, he thinks of loved ones
far away, and is seized with a longing to get into
touch with them once more, if only to notify
them of the catastrophe threatening him.</p>

<p>Across the intervening space, by what mechanism
we as yet do not know, his thought wings its
way to them, finds lodgment in their subconsciousness,
and thence, when favoring conditions arise&mdash;as
in some moment of mental relaxation&mdash;is
projected into their consciousness before, at the
time of, or after the sender&rsquo;s death, and is seen,
or heard, it may be, as a Phantom Drummer, a
Knocking Ghost, or the phantasmal image of the
sender himself.</p>

<p>If, however, conditions are such as to prevent
the message from emerging from the recipient&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
subconsciousness into his field of conscious vision,
it may, on occasion, as telepathic experiments
have proved, be retransmitted to a third party,
and by him be apprehended; as, for example, the
Drummer of Cortachy, in the two instances cited
above, was heard not by members of the Ogilvy
family, but by comparative strangers.</p>

<p>More than this, evidence has been accumulating
to make it certain that in most cases not even
telepathy is involved in the creation of ghosts,
but that they are merely products of the seer&rsquo;s
own subconsciousness. This was first clearly indicated
by the results of an interesting &ldquo;census
of hallucinations,&rdquo; originated some years ago at
the International Congress of Psychology, and
simultaneously carried on&mdash;principally by members
of the Society for Psychical Research&mdash;in
the United States, England, France, Germany,
and other countries. To thousands of persons
the question was put:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever, when believing yourself to
be completely awake, had a vivid impression of
seeing or being touched by a living being or inanimate
object, or of hearing a voice, which impression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
so far as you could discover, was not
due to any external physical cause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the 27,339 replies received to this question<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
no fewer than 3,266 were in the affirmative. Many
of those replying narrated true &ldquo;ghost stories&rdquo;
similar to the ones given above; many testified
to apparitions not of dead persons but of living
friends; and in addition to this, the replies of
many others brought out the interesting fact
that there often were &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; of inanimate
objects&mdash;of hats and chairs and tables as well
as of human beings.</p>

<p>One respondent, Mrs. Savile Lumley, testified
that, in broad daylight and while taking a calisthenic
lesson, she and another young woman
&ldquo;distinctly saw a chair over which we felt we
must fall, and called out to each other to avoid it.
But no chair was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Reverend G. Lyon Turner, professor of
philosophy at the Lancashire Independent College,
Manchester, England, woke up one morning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
find the ceiling of his room adorned with a huge
chandelier of some ten arms, and the jets shining
brightly through the ground-glass globes at the
end of each arm. He knew that when he went to
bed no chandelier had been there, and naturally
feared that something was the matter with his
eyesight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I moved my head,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see whether
the phantom moved, too. But no, it remained
fixed; and the objects behind and beyond it
became more or less completely visible as I
moved, exactly as would have been the case had
it been a real chandelier. So I woke my wife,
but she saw nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even more bizarre was the phantasm that
appeared to another Englishman. Here is his
own account of it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had just gone to bed, and was&mdash;at least,
this was my impression at the time&mdash;quite
awake. The door of my room was ajar, and there
was a light in the passage which half-illumined
my room. Suddenly I became aware of a series
of slight taps on the passage outside. These taps
were not sufficiently loud for a human footstep;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
on the other hand, the volume of their sound was
greater than that made by a walking-stick. I
fully remember sitting up in bed and beholding
two top-boots trot rapidly across the room and
vanish into the opposite wall. The illusion was
astonishingly vivid, and I can recall the details
to this day. I have never had a waking dream
since, and have never experienced ambulant top-boots
except on this occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whence the origin of these odd apparitions?
The reply of modern science is that they were
nothing more than the weird externalization of
ideas latent in the minds of those perceiving them.
Indeed, in the case of Mr. Turner there is absolute
proof that this was the case, for that gentleman
afterwards identified the phantom chandelier
with one familiar to him as hanging from the
ceiling of the college chapel in which he daily said
prayers. Furthermore, there is proof&mdash;of which
an abundance will be given in subsequent chapters&mdash;that
often the ideas thus externalized relate
to things once seen or heard but long since forgotten;
it may be to things seen or heard in a
wholly unconscious, or, rather, subconscious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
way. And as with ideas of things, so with ideas
of persons.</p>

<p>In this connection, as illuminating vividly the
problem of ghosts, may well be given an experience
narrated to me by Doctor Morton Prince,
the eminent Boston psychopathologist, or medical
psychologist.</p>

<p>A patient of his came to him one morning in a
condition of extreme nervousness, declaring that
the previous night she had seen a ghost. &ldquo;I woke
up,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and saw at the foot of my bed
a young woman, who gradually faded away.&rdquo;
She maintained that at no time had she seen anybody
resembling the apparition, but in the minute
description she gave, Doctor Prince at once recognized
a relative of his, with whom he remembered
he had been talking in the hall when the
patient last visited him. Saying nothing to her he
quietly assembled a few photographs, and, before
she departed, asked her to look them over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, picking one up, &ldquo;here is my
ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was Doctor Prince&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;and you
saw your ghost in this house when you were here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
only a few days ago. I was talking to her as you
came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected the patient, &ldquo;I certainly did
not see her, for I noticed somebody was with you,
and I purposely turned away as I passed, lest I
should seem rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Doctor Prince, &ldquo;you saw
her without being conscious of it&mdash;saw her, as it
were, out of the corner of your eye. One fleeting
glance would be enough to give you the memory
image that you mistook for a ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Doctor Prince was right, and
undoubtedly this dual law of subconscious perception
and memory is enough to account for
some of the most impressive ghosts cited in this
chapter. Even the strange haunting of the Petit
Trianon, as experienced by Miss Morison and Miss
Lamont, may be said to find its explanation here.</p>

<p>It is true that both Miss Morison and Miss
Lamont profess to have known little about the
history of the Petit Trianon previous to their
visit to Versailles. But their detailed report of
the haunting contains statements showing that,
subconsciously at any rate, they must have possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
considerable knowledge of the place. Miss
Morison admits that she had, as a girl, great enthusiasm
for Marie Antoinette, and had read not
a little about her, including an article descriptive
of her summer home; while Miss Lamont is a
teacher of French history, and accordingly must
have had rather more knowledge than the average
person regarding the life story of Queen Marie.
Besides which, and most significant, there was
published, just before they went to Versailles,
an illustrated magazine article picturing a historical
fête in the gardens of the Petit Trianon,
with some account of its history.</p>

<p>It is worth noting, too, that the two ladies were
not haunted in exactly the same way, each of
them seeing certain people and scenes that were
not visible to the other. On the theory of a supernatural
manifestation this would be hard to
explain, but the difficulty vanishes if we recognize
that the subconscious knowledge of the Trianon
possessed by each must necessarily have differed.</p>

<p>The problem remains to account for the fact,
as distinct from the facts, of the haunting. Why
should Miss Morison and Miss Lamont, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
all the thousands of visitors to the Petit Trianon,
alone have had such an experience? To this,
assuredly, there is no answer if one is going to
stick to the old-fashioned notion of ghosts and
attribute to them objective reality. But the
answer is very simple on the modern scientific
hypothesis.</p>

<p>Miss Morison and Miss Lamont, the psychologist
would say, were haunted for the reason that,
being of exceptionally romantic, impressionable
temperaments, the ideas associated in their minds
with the Petit Trianon, appealed to them with
such &ldquo;suggestive&rdquo; force as to plunge them for
the time being into a state of &ldquo;psychical dissociation,&rdquo;
during which their subconsciousness obtained
complete control over the upper consciousness,
and flooded them with its latent memories
of all that they had ever read or heard about the
place and its historic residents. In other words,
they were as two persons &ldquo;dreaming awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same explanation would obviously apply
to the ghostly vision seen on the lawn by Mrs. M.
Nor do we need to go beyond the hypothesis of
subconscious perception to account for the experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of Lady Eardley and the guest at the
Boston hotel. In the latter case it is necessary to
assume nothing more than that the lady who saw
the apparition at the elevator entrance perceived
her danger without being aware of it, and subconsciously
developed the hallucination that enabled
her to avoid it.</p>

<p>As to the Eardley case, it is a well-established
medical fact that some diseases, in their initial
stages, cause organic changes too slight to be
noticed by the sufferer&rsquo;s upper consciousness, but
plainly perceptible to his subconsciousness which,
through symbolical dreams or hallucinations,
sometimes seeks to convey to the upper consciousness
a warning that all is not well.</p>

<p>I myself have had such an experience. A number
of years ago, beginning in the summer, I was
troubled by a recurrent nightmare in which, although
the details were not always the same,
the central incident never varied. Always the
nightmare ended with a phantom cat clawing
viciously at my throat. I did not then know as
much about dreams as I do now, so, beyond
thinking vaguely that &ldquo;it must mean something,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I paid no attention to this repeated nightmare.</p>

<p>At the end of six months I had an attack of
grippe, necessitating treatment by a throat specialist,
who speedily discovered in my throat a growth
of which I consciously had had no knowledge.
With its removal the recurrent dream of the cat
instantly ceased to trouble me.</p>

<p>Lady Eardley&rsquo;s case was, doubtless, quite similar,
the only difference being that the subconscious
warning was conveyed to her upper consciousness,
not in dream, but as an auditory hallucination.
And, in the somewhat parallel case of the ghost
seen by Doctor Langtry, it seems a safe assumption
that if the frightened clergyman had advised
the child&rsquo;s father to place her under medical care
at once, the subsequent fatality might have been
averted.</p>

<p>In the Langtry case, however, there must have
been operative also a telepathic factor. And since
the telepathic explanation of ghosts is still the
subject of much controversy, it will be well, before
proceeding farther, to state exactly what is
known to-day regarding telepathy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="f8">WHY I BELIEVE IN TELEPATHY</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Some</span> years ago, when living near New York,
I had a curious dream that made a deep impression
on me. In this dream I seemed to be
at a club or hotel, when a messenger boy entered
and announced that I was wanted up-stairs.
There I found in a large room a family with whom
I had been intimate in my boyhood in Canada.
I had heard nothing of them for years, and naturally
was delighted to see them. But I was struck
with the absence of one of the sons, Archie, who,
as a youngster of about my own age, had been
one of my closest friends.</p>

<p>To my inquiry as to why he was not with
them, I was told: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; a statement
which, despite its vagueness, seemed in the dream
a wholly adequate and satisfactory reply. When
I awoke, however, with the dream details vividly
in mind, I had a strong feeling that, as I said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
my wife: &ldquo;Something serious must have happened
to Archie Tisdale.&rdquo; The sequel proved
that this feeling was amply justified.</p>

<p>For it developed that, at about the time of my
dream, he had died from an illness of which I
knew nothing until, prompted by the dream, I
made inquiries about him.</p>

<p>Again, many years earlier, whiling away the
time one summer evening in a green lane that led
to the shore of a beautiful Canadian lake, I had
an experience which similarly gave me food for
thought. I had been leaning on a rail fence,
taking in the glories of the fading sunset. It
was one of those evenings and one of those scenes
of which poets delight to sing, and as I gazed
across the lake at the changing hues on the distant
hills, slowly turning from blue to gray as
the twilight deepened, I gave myself up to the
pleasurable day-dreaming so common in the romantic
age of youth.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was roused by hearing my name
called, in a tone so faint, albeit perfectly audible,
that for a moment I could fancy the call came
from beyond the lake. The next instant, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I realized that it was what, with my larger
psychological knowledge of to-day, I should term
wholly subjective, coming from within me rather
than from without; and at the same time I distinctly
got the impression that it was connected
in some way with accident or illness befalling a
young lady in whom I was then much interested&mdash;the
young lady, in fact, who afterwards became
my wife.</p>

<p>It was in vain that I sought to dismiss this
impression as a mere freak of the imagination.
So insistent did it at last become that I returned
to the house and hastily scribbled a note, stating
what I had heard&mdash;or, rather, thought I had
heard&mdash;and expressing the hope that all was
well.</p>

<p>My letter had to go to a distant city, and it
was therefore several days before an answer
could arrive. I well remember how, in the interval,
I fretted and worried. But by return
mail a reassuring reply reached me. Only, most
strangely, the writer added that late in the afternoon
of the day on which I heard the hallucinatory
call, she had been overcome by heat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was for some hours thought to be in a serious
condition.</p>

<p>Once again I heard the same weird inward calling
of my name&mdash;this time at eleven o&rsquo;clock on
the night of a Fourth of July celebration, when I
was lounging in a hammock on the bank of the
Niagara River, watching the last of the fireworks
on the American side. I was quite alone, as the
friends with whom I was staying had retired an
hour or more before; and, for that matter, it
was not their custom to address me by my first
name. Yet I heard myself called, faintly but
distinctly, and seemingly from across the water,
precisely as in my previous experience.</p>

<p>As in that experience, also, I instinctively associated
the calling with my absent sweetheart,
and wrote to her at once. Two days later, our
letters crossing, I received word that on the
night of the Fourth she had taken an overdose of
headache powder, with consequences that might
have been serious had not medical assistance
been promptly obtained.</p>

<p>But even more singular than any of the foregoing
is a happening connected with an accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that occurred to my wife while she was still a
mere schoolgirl.</p>

<p>With a party of young people she had gone on
an outing to a Maine lake resort, and in the dusk
of a pleasant evening started for a drive in an old-fashioned
hay-wagon. There was no thought of
danger, and the drive was thoroughly enjoyed
by all until, coming down a long and rather
steep hill, the breeching broke, and the horses
ran away. At a sharp turn in the road, half-way
down the hill, the drive came to a sudden and
disastrous end with the overturning of the wagon.</p>

<p>A number of its occupants were seriously hurt,
my wife, with great presence of mind, saving herself
by jumping clear of the wagon just as it began
to go over. Even so, she did not escape
uninjured, her face being badly cut.</p>

<p>Now comes the curious part of the affair. Early
the next morning a telegram from her mother in
Boston was handed to her. It read: &ldquo;Are you
hurt or ill? Wire at once. Am writing.&rdquo; The
letter which followed gave the amazing information
that the previous night&mdash;that is, the night
of the accident&mdash;the mother had had an unusually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
vivid dream in which she saw her daughter
driving in a carriage, thrown out of the carriage,
and badly cut about the face. So realistic was
the dream that on waking it frightened her, and
led to the sending of the telegram.</p>

<p>Obviously the question arises: Were these
four strange experiences representative merely
of extraordinary chance coincidences, or were
they indicative of the action of some direct means
of communication from mind to mind by other
than the ordinary recognized channels of communication?</p>

<p>Personally I am satisfied that chance alone will
not suffice to account for them, and that they are
veritable instances of the workings of a faculty
latent in all mankind and operable in accordance
with a true, if as yet little understood, law of
nature&mdash;call it telepathy, thought transference,
or what you will.</p>

<p>And in saying this, I am well aware that, even
if my belief is in agreement with that entertained
by many eminent men of science&mdash;such
as Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William Crookes, Camille
Flammarion, Charles Richet, Theodore Flournoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Henri Morselli, Professor W.&nbsp;F. Barrett and the
late William James&mdash;it is contrary to the opinion
held by the great majority of scientists at the
present day. Their view, to put it briefly, is that
there is no such thing as telepathy; that chance
coincidence, deliberate or unconscious falsification,
and errors of memory are sufficient to explain
most instances of alleged telepathic communication;
and that the remainder are reducible
to the operation of more or less familiar principles
in the psychology of the subconscious&mdash;notably
the law of hyperæsthesia, or unusual extension
of the senses of sight, hearing, smell, etc.</p>

<p>I am perfectly willing to admit that much
which passes as telepathy may be thus reducible.
For example, I am seated writing at the desk in
my study. Unexpectedly there flashes into my
mind an idea concerning a person of whom I
have not thought for weeks or months. The next
instant the doorbell rings, and presently the maid
informs me that the very person of whom I have
that moment been thinking has entered the
house.</p>

<p>This is a not infrequent experience, as most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of my readers will concede. So frequent is it
that it is absurd to attempt to account for it
on the hypothesis of chance coincidence. But
neither would it be always safe to raise the theory
of telepathy. For it might well happen that
while I was seated intent on my work, with the
study windows closed, my ear nevertheless caught
the sound of footsteps coming down the street,
or on my porch; that I subconsciously recognized
in them my friend&rsquo;s walk, and that I consequently,
though without knowing why, thought
of him at that precise moment. This is assuredly
a possible explanation&mdash;though I am far from
conceding that in all such cases it is the only
explanation properly applicable.</p>

<p>So, likewise, one must be constantly on guard
against over-readily accepting as evidences of
telepathic action the feats of &ldquo;mind reading&rdquo;
often undertaken by way of parlor amusement.
Stage &ldquo;mind reading&rdquo; by professional entertainers
may be safely left out of the reckoning,
as undoubtedly based on methods of conscious
trickery and deceit. But in a private gathering,
where there can be no question of confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and deliberate signaling, surprising results are
sometimes obtained in the finding of hidden
objects, etc. On the surface this would seem
explicable only on a telepathic basis, yet in
reality it is commonly brought about by &ldquo;muscle
reading&rdquo; rather than by true &ldquo;mind reading.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Experiment has shown that the effort to concentrate
thought on a given matter&mdash;a name
or an object&mdash;tends to produce some form of
muscular activity, either subconscious whispering
of the name thought of, or subconscious movement
in the direction of the object. If, as is the
rule, the spectators are supposed to keep their
minds fixed intently on the name or object they
have selected for the &ldquo;test,&rdquo; some of them are
apt to give these involuntary muscular hints,
which the performer will accept and act upon,
it may be without being clearly conscious of the
source of his information.</p>

<p>Still it must be added that experiments in the
&ldquo;willing game&rdquo; have been carried out under
conditions and with results indicating that occasionally,
at all events, successes are achieved
without any such subconscious guidance. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
so very long ago some interesting and most
striking experiments of this sort were described
to me by Professor J.&nbsp;H. Hyslop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The subject of my experiments,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;was a young woman of good family, who was
credited with having exceptional ability in divining
the thoughts and wishes of others. It was
arranged that I should investigate her powers,
and accordingly for a period of some weeks I had
frequent sittings with her, in the presence of a
few interested and trustworthy friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plan followed in every experiment was
this: The young woman having left the room,
I mentally selected some more or less complicated
action for her to perform upon her return. I then
wrote down on a slip of paper what I wished her
to do, showed it to the others, and concealed it
in a book, which did not leave my hand until
after the completion of the experiment. From
first to last not a word was spoken by any one,
so as to guard against any possible hyperæsthesia
of hearing on her part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young woman was then called back, and
almost invariably proceeded to execute the commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
mentally given her. She did this so
promptly that I cannot conceive how she could
possibly have got any unconscious hints from
those present, and conscious signaling was out
of the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, I once wrote on my paper an
order for her to pick out of a vase a bunch of
keys I had hidden there, cross the room with the
keys, and place them on the mantel-piece. She
entered, stood for but a moment with her eyes
closed, and then, swiftly passing to the vase,
which was on the floor, picked up the keys,
turned, and deposited them on the mantel-piece
as I had mentally suggested. It was all done so
quickly and spontaneously that to my mind it
afforded strong evidential proof of true thought
transference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was not always successful, but some of
her failures were quite as instructive as her successes.
On three occasions she executed, not
the commands I had written on the paper, but
commands I had thought of writing but for one
reason or another had abandoned. No one in
the room excepting myself knew of these previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
intentions, so she could have derived her knowledge
of them from the involuntary movements of
no one excepting me; and if it had actually been
a matter of subconscious guidance, it is obvious
that my muscular indications would have related
not to the abandoned commands but to the commands
I actually wished her to carry out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things considered, my experiments with
this young woman satisfy me that the hypothesis
of subconscious guidance is not always properly
applicable, even when the &lsquo;mind reader&rsquo; is in a
position to see or hear the persons testing him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Assuming, however, for the sake of argument,
that Professor Hyslop&rsquo;s conclusion is erroneous,
and that the involuntary movement theory does
always suffice as an explanatory hypothesis when
experimenter and subject are in the same rooms,
it becomes manifestly and hopelessly inadequate
when applied to explain the transmission of ideas
between persons a considerable distance apart.
Yet what I consider abundant proof has been
experimentally obtained that such transmission
may, and sometimes does, take place&mdash;occasionally
in most dramatic form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Take, for example, the experience of a French
lady, Mme. Clarence de Vaux-Royer, who, feeling
uneasy one day about a friend who was then
living in the United States, thought she would
cable to him. Unfortunately it was Sunday, and
her maid found the cable office closed. Mme. de
Vaux-Royer then decided to attempt a telepathic
experiment, and, knowing that her friend
was mourning the death of his mother and of a
favorite sister, decided to try and impress him
with an idea that they were near him and would
comfort him in any trial he might be undergoing.
She told her maid of her intention, and
asked the maid to note the date, so as to be
able to give corroborative evidence if the experiment
succeeded.</p>

<p>This was on November 7. Ten days later the
American mail brought to Mme. de Vaux-Royer
a letter from her absent friend, who, after referring
to some matters of wholly private interest,
stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night (the 7th), while I was praying, I
saw, hovering above my head, some gold circles,
which gradually floated away until I could no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
longer see them. At the same time I seemed to
hear some one calling to me: &lsquo;Mother! Mother!
Sister Minnie!&rsquo; Then the circles floated back,
approaching until they almost touched my head.
Oh, how much comfort I felt! How they inspired
me with sentiments of goodness and happiness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this it is manifestly only a step to the
experimental production of telepathic phantasms
of the human form, as in the two instances given
in the previous chapter (the Wesermann and
Sinclair experiments), and in numerous other
instances, of which one or two additional may
well be narrated here. In one, a Harvard professor,
an acquaintance of Professor James, on
whose authority I quote the story, having heard
of the possibility of telepathic hallucinations,
determined one evening that he would try to
make an apparition of himself appear to a friend,
a young lady who lived half a mile from his
home. He did not mention his intention to her
or to anybody else. The next day he received a
letter, in which she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night about ten o&rsquo;clock I was in the
dining-room at supper with B. Suddenly I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
thought I saw you looking in through the crack
of the door at the end of the room, toward which
I was looking. I said to B.: &lsquo;There is Blank,
looking through the crack of the door!&rsquo; B., whose
back was toward the door, said: &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t be
there. He would come right in.&rsquo; However, I
got up and looked in the other room, but there
was nobody there. Now, what were you doing
last night, at that time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that precise moment, as he told Professor
James, &ldquo;Blank&rdquo; had been at home, sitting alone
in his room, and trying &ldquo;whether I could project
my astral body to the presence of A.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Possibly had the young lady been alone, and
not actively engaged, she might have had a
more definite view of the phantasm of her absent
friend, for experience has shown that solitude
and quiet are favoring conditions for the perception
of telepathic apparitions. In nearly every
instance reported to the Society for Psychical
Research the percipient of the phantasm is alone
and in a more or less passive, quiescent frame
of mind. Such a condition usually obtains
immediately before or immediately after sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and it is then that experimental apparitions are
seen most plainly. Though occasionally they
are vividly experienced when the percipient is
in a state of the most active consciousness, as
in the following case, reported by the agent&mdash;that
is, the person sending the telepathic message&mdash;and
confirmed by the percipient, an
English clergyman now dead, the Reverend W.
Stainton Moses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One evening,&rdquo; runs the agent&rsquo;s account, &ldquo;I
resolved to try to appear to Z., at some miles
distance. I did not inform him beforehand of
the intended experiment; but retired to rest
shortly before midnight with thoughts intently
fixed on Z., with whose rooms and surroundings,
however, I was quite unacquainted. I soon fell
asleep, and awoke next morning unconscious of
anything having taken place. On seeing Z. a
few days afterward, I inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did anything happen at your rooms on
Saturday night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;a great deal happened.
I had been sitting over the fire with M., smoking
and chatting. About twelve-thirty he rose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
leave, and I let him out myself. I returned to
the fire to finish my pipe, when I saw you sitting
in the chair just vacated by him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I looked intently at you, and then took up
a newspaper to assure myself I was not dreaming,
but on laying it down I saw you still there. While
I gazed without speaking, you faded away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course in the case of all single experiments
like these,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the skeptically inclined might plausibly
fall back on the theory of chance coincidence.
But it is impossible seriously to entertain this
hypothesis in cases where experiments in the
telepathic transmission of ideas have been carried
on repeatedly and with an astonishing measure
of success.</p>

<p>To mention only the most notable experiments
of this systematic kind, I would call attention
to the results obtained by two sets of
English investigators, the first comprising two
ladies named Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden,
the second two gentlemen, F.&nbsp;R. Burt and
F.&nbsp;L. Usher. As I see it, indeed, the Miles-Ramsden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and Burt-Usher experiments have the
additional interest that they not only make clear
some of the fundamental laws of genuine thought
transference, but also show just why it is that
we can never hope to obtain such absolute control
of the telepathic process as to be able to send
mental messages from one to another with the
same ease and certainty as we now send ordinary
telegrams and marconigrams.</p>

<p>This inability of control has long been a stock
objection against belief in telepathy, especially
among the scientifically trained. &ldquo;Not until
we can repeat at will, and with invariable success,
the experiment of direct transference of thought,
will we accept telepathy as established,&rdquo; say these
scientific skeptics. &ldquo;We know that if, in our
chemical and physical laboratories, we bring
such and such elements together, such and such
action will always follow. We must be able to
do as much with telepathy before we will accept
it.&rdquo; But the Miles-Ramsden and Burt-Usher
experiments show that there are excellent reasons
for affirming that telepathy is a fact, and that
nevertheless its processes cannot be governed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
with the certitude possible in the case of chemical
and physical processes. There are factors involved
which elude, and must always elude, the
directive control of the experimenter.</p>

<p>In the experiments by the Misses Miles and
Ramsden it was arranged that, at a stated hour
of a stated evening in each week, Miss Ramsden&mdash;who
acted throughout as the percipient, or
receiver of the telepathic messages&mdash;was to
remain for a few minutes in a condition of complete
passivity, and immediately afterwards was
to note on a post-card whatever ideas came into
her mind during that time. The post-card was
then to be mailed to Miss Miles, who, for her
part, was to think of Miss Ramsden at intervals
during the day agreed on, and in the evening
was to make a post-card entry&mdash;to be mailed to
her friend forthwith&mdash;of the idea or ideas she
had tried to convey to her telepathically. Thus,
in the event of achieving any degree of success,
they would have a perfect documentary record
to substantiate their claims.</p>

<p>As to the distance separating them, it ranged
from a few score to several hundred miles. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
made, in fact, three distinct series of experiments,
with about a year&rsquo;s interval between each series.
During the first they were at their homes, Miss
Miles in London, Miss Ramsden in Buckinghamshire.
During the second, Miss Ramsden was
in Inverness, in northern Scotland, and Miss
Miles visiting friends in various parts of England.
The third series was carried on while Miss Miles
was making a tour of the beautiful Ardennes
region of France and Belgium, Miss Ramsden
at the same time being again in the Scottish
Highlands.</p>

<p>Thus there was a progressive increase in the
distance between them for each series, but this
seems to have made no difference in the result.
In each, as the attested record shows, Miss
Ramsden succeeded in getting, completely or in
part, no fewer than two out of every five of the
messages her co-experimenter tried to &ldquo;telepath&rdquo;
to her. Such a proportion is clearly too
high to be explained away on the theory of
chance coincidence, and this theory is rendered
still more untenable by the attendant circumstances
which the record reveals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion Miss Miles, who is an artist,
had been busy in the afternoon painting a model&rsquo;s
hands. She thought of this when evening came,
and determined to endeavor to impress Miss
Ramsden with the idea &ldquo;hands&rdquo;. In her post-card,
written at seven o&rsquo;clock the same evening,
Miss Ramsden stated that of several ideas which
had come into her mind at the experiment-hour
the &ldquo;most vivid&rdquo; was &ldquo;a little black hand, quite
small, much smaller than a child&rsquo;s, well formed,
and the fingers straight. This was the chief
thing.</p>

<p>Similarly, having noticed at a meeting in London
a curious pair of spectacles worn by a gentleman
seated near her, Miss Miles, on returning
home in the early evening, wrote down the word
&ldquo;spectacles,&rdquo; with the idea of &ldquo;telepathing&rdquo;
it to Miss Ramsden. The latter&rsquo;s post-card entry
for that evening noted that &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo; was
&ldquo;the only idea that came to me after waiting a
long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, while on a sketching expedition to an
English village, Miss Miles was much amused
by an adventure with a large white pig. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
selected this pig as the subject of her next telepathic
communication, the result of which Miss
Ramsden, writing as almost always on the night
of the experiment, thus reported:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were out of doors rather late, a cold, raw
evening, near a railway station; there was a pig
with a long snout, and some village children.
It was getting dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, in several instances Miss
Ramsden&rsquo;s impressions contained much which
Miss Miles had not consciously sought to convey
to her. And this brings us to what is unquestionably
the most important feature of the experiments.</p>

<p>As was said, about two out of every five messages
were correctly received, in whole or in part.
But it frequently happened in the case of the
seeming failures, that while Miss Ramsden did not
get the ideas which Miss Miles was endeavoring
to send to her, she did get ideas relating to people,
things and events much in Miss Miles&rsquo;s mind at
that moment, or which had been more or less
in her mind during the day of the experiment.</p>

<p>To illustrate, Miss Miles once tried to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Miss Ramsden think of &ldquo;pussies, or cats.&rdquo;
What Miss Ramsden did think of was &ldquo;a manuscript,
pinned by a patent fastener in one corner.&rdquo;
And, oddly enough, Miss Miles had spent
a good part of that afternoon reading to a friend
from a manuscript &ldquo;fastened together,&rdquo; as the
friend has testified, &ldquo;with a patent fastener.&rdquo;
Similarly, during Miss Miles&rsquo;s visit to the English
village above mentioned, Miss Ramsden&rsquo;s report
for one experiment ran:</p>

<p>&ldquo;First I saw dimly a house, but I think that
you wish me to see a little girl with brown hair
down her back, tied with a ribbon in the usual
way. She is sitting at a table with her back
turned and seems very busy indeed. I think she
is cutting out scraps with a pair of scissors. She
has on a white pinafore, and I should guess her
age to be between eight and twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Miles had not been trying to make Miss
Ramsden think of anything of the sort. But the
description fitted perfectly her landlady&rsquo;s little
daughter, of whom the mother, Mrs. Laura Lovegrove,
says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a little girl aged eleven, with brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
hair, tied with a ribbon in the usual way. She
wears a pinafore, and, being ill, often amuses
herself cutting out scraps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another time, when the hour for the experiment
arrived, Miss Miles forgot all about it,
being busy writing letters to some friends. In
particular she was absorbed in framing an answer
to an important letter from a Polish artist,
written in a peculiar script. Miss Ramsden&rsquo;s report
for that evening was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt that you were not thinking of me, but
were reading a letter in a sort of half-German
writing. The letters have very long tails to
them. Is there any truth in that?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Significant also is the fact that precisely the
same sort of thing occurred in the more recent experiments
between Mr. Burt and Mr. Usher, who,
like Miss Miles and Miss Ramsden, conducted
their investigations in a careful, methodical, conscientious
way, and over a long period of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Usher, like Miss Miles, invariably acted
as the sender of the telepathic communications,
while Mr. Burt was the percipient. From first
to last the latter remained in London, while
Mr. Usher was part of the time in Bristol, more
than one hundred miles from London, and part
of the time in the Austrian city of Prague, a
thousand miles away. On each experiment-evening
it was Mr. Usher&rsquo;s practice, at the hour
previously agreed upon, to sit alone in a dimly
lighted room, draw some design on a piece of
paper, and remain for fifteen minutes thinking
intently of the design and &ldquo;willing&rdquo; to transmit
it to Mr. Burt, who, at the same hour, would
be seated in a darkened room in London, noting
the images that passed before his mind&rsquo;s eye,
and, at the expiration of fifteen minutes, setting
down on paper the one or two that had seemed
to him most vivid.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty experiments were thus made, with
results defying any explanation by the theory
of chance coincidence. And, as in the Miles-Ramsden
experiments&mdash;for the matter of that,
as also in Professor Hyslop&rsquo;s experiments&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
at times happened that when Mr. Burt totally
failed to draw a design corresponding with that
which Mr. Usher had drawn, Mr. Burt&rsquo;s design
did correspond with images demonstrably in Mr.
Usher&rsquo;s mind at or immediately before the
moment of the experiment.</p>

<p>Thus, one evening in Prague Mr. Usher tried
to make Mr. Burt get the impression of an oblong
composed of numerous small dots. Instead Mr.
Burt saw and designed a peculiar plume-like
ornamentation, which Mr. Usher instantly recognized
as a picture of part of the unusual carving
on the table at which he had been seated. On
another occasion&mdash;the eighteenth experiment&mdash;Mr.
Usher sought to transmit a crude design of a
flower in a pot. What Mr. Burt actually drew
was an excellent representation of a lighted cigarette
with the smoke curling away from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; says Mr. Usher, &ldquo;the evening that he
drew this was the first evening I had smoked a
cigarette while experimenting with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such incidents, with those cited in connection
with the experiments of Professor Hyslop and
the Misses Miles and Ramsden, in my opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
go to show exactly why it is that one cannot hope
to obtain unfailing control over the process of
telepathy. For they indicate that at bottom
genuine thought transference depends not so
much on conscious <em>willing</em> as on subconscious
<em>feeling</em>. It is not necessarily the things about
which one thinks most strongly, but rather things
which are tinged with some emotional coloring,
that are most likely to become subjects of telepathic
communication.</p>

<p>And these experiments further indicate that, on
the receiver&rsquo;s part also, the mechanism involved
in the transmission of telepathic messages belongs
rather to the subconscious than to the
conscious portion of the mind. In order to allow
the emergence of the transmitted ideas into the
field of conscious knowledge, there seems to be
always necessary some form of psychical &ldquo;dissociation&rdquo;&mdash;as
in a trance, dream, reverie, or
moment of absentmindedness. Such states of
dissociation are not always easy to bring about
voluntarily; and when they are brought about,
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, it by no
means follows that ideas received telepathically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
will forthwith and rapidly rise above the threshold
of consciousness.</p>

<p>For, as recent psychological experiment and
observation have shown, in dissociated states
the tendency is for the emergence chiefly of
ideas which, through their emotional associations,
are of deep personal significance&mdash;as when we
dream of persons or things associated with events
that once affected us profoundly. Every one of
us has subconscious reminiscences of this sort,
and with these personal subconscious reminiscences
any ideas which have been transmitted
telepathically have of necessity to compete for
emergence. They may get through or they may
not; whether they will get through apparently
depends in large measure on the degree of their
own emotional intensity.</p>

<p>Hence it is that that scientist is doomed to
perpetual unbelief who boasts that he will never
place credence in telepathy until he can play
with it as he plays with the chemicals in his test
tubes. One cannot handle feelings as one can
handle a chemical compound, nor can one manipulate
at will the subconscious as though it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a physical substance. Hence, too, the case for
telepathy must always rest less on experimental
evidence&mdash;strong though the Miles-Ramsden
and Burt-Usher experiments demonstrate that
this sometimes is&mdash;than on well-authenticated
instances of spontaneous occurrence, which have
been recorded in ever-increasing volume since
systematic investigation of the subject was first
undertaken a scant quarter of a century ago.</p>

<p>In such instances, the records further show,
one of the commonest forms in which the telepathic
message is received is that of an auditory
hallucination, as in the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; heard by me on
the shore of the Canadian lake and on the bank
of Niagara River. When there is connected with
the sending of the message some supreme crisis
in the career of the sender&mdash;the crisis, it may be,
of the moment of death&mdash;the auditory hallucination
is sometimes of such a nature as to
make its dire meaning almost self-evident. In
this respect I know of nothing more striking
than a strange case reported, with ample corroborative
evidence, to the Society for Psychical
Research.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The narrator, a well-to-do Englishman, was
living at the time in a country house. It was
early spring, and on the night of his telepathic
experience there had been a slight snowfall, just
sufficient to make the ground white. After
dinner he spent the evening writing until ten
o&rsquo;clock, when, to continue the story in his own
words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got up and left the room, taking a lamp
from the hall table, and placing it on a small table
standing in a recess of the window in the breakfast-room.
The curtains were not drawn across
the window. I had just taken down from the
nearest bookcase a volume of &lsquo;Macgillivray&rsquo;s
British Birds&rsquo; for reference, and was in the act
of reading the passage, the book held close to
the lamp, and my shoulder touching the window
shutter, and in a position when almost the slightest
sound would be heard, when I distinctly heard
the front gate opened and shut again with a clap,
and footsteps advancing at a run up the drive;
when opposite the window the steps changed
from sharp and distinct on gravel to dull and
less clear on the grass-slip below the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and at the same time I was conscious that some
one or something stood close to me outside, only
the thin shutter and a sheet of glass dividing
us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could hear the quick, panting, labored
breathing of the messenger, or whatever it was,
as if trying to recover breath before speaking.
Had he been attracted by the light through the
shutter? Suddenly, like a gunshot, inside, outside,
and all around, there broke out the most
appalling shriek&mdash;a prolonged wail of horror,
which seemed to freeze the blood. It was not a
single shriek, but more prolonged, commencing
in a high key, and then less and less, wailing
away toward the north, and becoming weaker
and weaker as it receded in sobbing pulsations
of intense agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of my fright and horror I can say nothing&mdash;increased
tenfold when I walked into the dining-room
and found my wife sitting quietly at her
work close to the window, in the same line and
distant only ten or twelve feet from the corresponding
window in the breakfast-room. <em>She
had heard nothing.</em> I could see that at once;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and from the position in which she was sitting,
I knew she could not have failed to hear any
noise outside and any footsteps on the ground.
Perceiving I was alarmed about something, she
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only some one outside,&rsquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, why do you not go out and see?
You always do when you hear any unusual
noise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is something queer and dreadful
about this noise,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;I dare not face it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard, and early next morning
he made a careful search in the grounds
around the house, but not a footprint was to be
seen in the snow, which had ceased falling long
before the occurrence of the wailing cry. A little
later in the day, however, word arrived that at
ten o&rsquo;clock the previous night one of his tenants,
who lived half a mile distant and with whom he
had spent the afternoon, had committed suicide
by drinking prussic acid.</p>

<p>He had gone up to his bedroom, his groom
testified at the inquest, had mixed the poison in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a tumbler of water, drank it off, and, with a terrible
scream, fell dead on the floor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, telepathic hallucinations do not
usually come with such intensity or in such an
alarming form. Often they are mere vague impressions
that something unpleasant or disastrous
is occurring to a relative or friend, and, as
in the case of self-originating hallucinations like
that reported by Lady Eardley, they occasionally
impel to action that averts disaster. It was thus,
to give a single instance, in an experience reported<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
by William Blakeway, a Staffordshire
Englishman:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in my usual place at chapel one Sunday
afternoon, when all at once I thought I must go
home. Seemingly against my will, I took my
hat. When reaching the chapel gates I felt an
impulse that I must hasten home as quick as
possible, and I ran with all my might without
stopping to take breath. Meeting a friend who
asked why I hurried so, I passed him almost without
notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I reached home I found the house full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of smoke, and my little boy, three years old, all
on fire, alone in the house. I at once tore the
burning clothes from off him, and was just in
time to save his life. It has always been a mystery
to me, as no person whispered a word to me, and
no one knew anything about the fire till after
I made the alarm at home, which was more than
a quarter of a mile from the chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the wholly subconscious nature of the
phenomenon, on the percipient&rsquo;s part at all
events, is plainly evident. It is even more evident
in all cases where, as frequently occurs, the
telepathic message is received in a dream like
that which was recorded in the opening paragraphs
of this chapter. As is to be expected, too,
in telepathic dreams we often find an element of
symbolism. The news of illness, of accident, of
death, or whatever it may be, is not conveyed
directly, but indirectly, amid a mass of more or
less relevant details of dream imagery.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I received a letter from a
lady living in Brooklyn, describing an experience
that admirably illustrates this point. Her dream,
however, was of such an intimate character that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the names of the persons and places must be
suppressed. Five years ago, this lady writes, her
daughter became interested in a young man,
Mr. V., whose suit, however, the mother discouraged.
Afterwards her daughter met, fell in
love with, and was happily married to a physician
in the Government service. She soon went
abroad with her husband, to a remote and isolated
post. My informant continues:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could not hear from them all winter
because they were ice-bound, but my thoughts
of them were always most delightful, for their
last letters were bubbling over with happiness,
and I was lovingly busy getting things ready for
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. V. had almost passed from my mind,
when one morning, in the middle of June, I
arose, took a bath, and, having a half-hour to
spare, went back to bed again, falling into a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly Mr. V. appeared to me in one of
my lower rooms. It seemed to be breakfast
time, and I invited him to have some. He accepted,
and we sat together for some time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I do not remember any of our conversation.
Suddenly he arose, faced me, and, looking straight
into my eyes, said emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now she is mine! Nothing you can do will
ever separate us again! This time she will belong
to me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I awoke with a start, much frightened. Then,
realizing the situation, I thanked Heaven she
was safely married, and promptly put the dream
from me. This was about eight o&rsquo;clock. At ten
a despatch reached me saying that my daughter&rsquo;s
husband had died, from the result of a boating
accident two weeks before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or, when apprehended in dream, the telepathic
message may be so distorted that its true meaning
cannot possibly be recognized immediately. A
characteristic case of this kind occurred at the
time of President Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination, though
it is only recently that it was for the first time
reported in detail by Mrs. E.&nbsp;H. Hughes, daughter
of the San Francisco architect, S.&nbsp;C. Bugbee.
It should be explained that before removing to
California from Massachusetts in 1863, the Bugbees
were well acquainted with the Booth family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and that John Wilkes Booth was an especial
favorite of Mrs. Bugbee&rsquo;s. Says Mrs. Hughes,
in her report to the American Institute for Scientific
Research:<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;One night my mother woke my father suddenly,
saying: &lsquo;Oh, Charles! I have had such
a terrible dream! I dreamed that John Wilkes
Booth shot me! It seemed that he sent me seats
for a private box in a theater, and I took some
young ladies with me. Between the acts he came
to me, and asked me how I liked the play. I
exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, John Booth! I am surprised
that you could put such a questionable play
upon the stage. I am mortified to think that
I have brought young ladies to see it.&rdquo; At that
he raised a pistol, and shot me in the back of the
neck. It seems as if I felt a pain there now.&rsquo;
After a while my mother fell asleep, and dreamed
the same thing a second time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning came the terrible news
which plunged the nation into grief and mourning.
Almost at the hour of my mother&rsquo;s dream, President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Lincoln was assassinated; shot, in the back
of the neck, in a private box at a theater, by
John Wilkes Booth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, there may be no symbolism
or distortion, the dream corresponding
so realistically with the event as to make its
significance manifest. To give an illustration,
Mrs. Morris Griffith, an Englishwoman, reports:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the night of Saturday, the eleventh of
March, I awoke in much alarm, having seen my
eldest son, then at St. Paul de Loanda on the
southwest coast of Africa, looking dreadfully ill
and emaciated, and I heard his voice distinctly
calling to me. I was so disturbed I could not
sleep again, but every time I closed my eyes the
appearance recurred, and his voice sounded distinctly,
calling me &lsquo;Mamma!&rsquo; I felt greatly
depressed all through the next day, which was
Sunday, but I did not mention it to my husband,
as he was an invalid, and I feared to disturb him.
Strange to say, he also suffered from intense low
spirits all day, and we were both unable to take
dinner, he rising from the table, saying: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
care what it costs, I must have the boy back,&rsquo; alluding
to his eldest son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mentioned my dream and the bad night
I had had to two or three friends, but begged
that they would say nothing of it to Mr. Griffith.
The next day a letter arrived, containing some
photos of my son, saying he had had fever, but
was better, and hoped immediately to leave for a
much more healthy station. We heard no more
till the ninth of May, when a letter arrived with
the news of our son&rsquo;s death from a fresh attack
of fever, on the night of the eleventh of March,
and adding that just before his death he kept
calling repeatedly for me.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is only a short transition from such a dream
as this to a waking hallucination in which&mdash;as
in the cases of experimental occurrence mentioned
above, and those other cases detailed in
the preceding chapter&mdash;phantom forms are discerned
at the moment when the person seen is
threatened by some danger or is passing through
the supreme crisis of death.</p>

<p>But now, accepting telepathy as an established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fact, the problem remains: How are we to explain
it? What is the mechanism by which one person
is able to transmit messages directly and instantaneously
to another person although they may
be half the world apart?</p>

<p>To this question, it must frankly be admitted,
no positive answer can as yet be returned. But
some extremely plausible hypotheses have been
advanced, not by mere theorists but by eminent
men of science, who, themselves affirming the
actuality of telepathy, have given much thought
to the problem of its mode of operation.</p>

<p>Sir William Crookes, for example, calling attention
to the marvelous but undisputed facts
of ethereal vibration as evidenced by the phenomena
of wireless telegraphy and the Röntgen
rays, urges that here we have quite possibly an
adequate explanation of the mystery of telepathy
on a wholly naturalistic basis&mdash;that is to say,
a basis which enables us to accept telepathy without
dislocating our entire conception of the
physical universe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he suggests, &ldquo;that in these
rays [Röntgen rays] we may have a possible way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of transmitting intelligence which, with a few reasonable
postulates, may supply the key to much
that is obscure in psychical research. Let it be
assumed that these rays, or rays of even higher
frequency, can pass into the brain and act on
some nervous center there. Let it be conceived
that the brain contains a center which uses these
rays as the vocal chords use sound vibrations
(both being under the command of intelligence),
and sends them out, with the velocity of light, to
impinge on the receiving ganglion of another
brain. In this same way the phenomena of
telepathy, and the transmission of intelligence
from one sensitive to another through long distances,
seem to come into the domain of law and
can be grasped.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>This undoubtedly is the explanation that most
strongly commends itself to those scientists who
courageously acknowledge their belief in telepathy.
Nor do they see any objection to it in the
fact that people apparently are affected by the
telepathic impulse only at certain times. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
brain of both sender and receiver may conceivably,
on the analogy of wireless telegraphy, be
set to transmit and receive telepathic communications
only when attuned to vibrations of a
certain amplitude. There is, however, as Sir
William Crookes himself has recognized, another
and really formidable objection to this vibratory
hypothesis.</p>

<p>It is found in the fact that, assuming telepathic
messages to be conveyed by a system of infinitely
minute waves in the ether, we logically have also
to assume that these waves would still obey
what is known as the law of inverse squares.
By this is meant that, spreading on every side
in ever-expanding waves, they would lose power
in proportion to the square of the distance from
their source. Consequently, it would not only
require a tremendous initial energy to project
them any great distance, but the farther they
were sent the feebler they would become, so that
in the case of a percipient remote from the agent,
either the telepathic message would not be received
at all or at most it would be received in
exceedingly attenuated fashion. Whereas the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fact is that, according to the results of such experimentation
as that which I have described,
complete failure often occurs when the experimenters
are only a few yards apart, and brilliant
successes are sometimes achieved at distances of
hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>This consideration has led some thinkers&mdash;notably
Sir Oliver Lodge, Professor W.&nbsp;F. Barrett,
and the late F.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H. Myers&mdash;to abandon outright
all attempt at an explanation on a naturalistic
basis, and to advance instead the view that
telepathy is not explicable in physical terms
because it is a wholly psychical process&mdash;&ldquo;a
direct and supersensuous communion of mind
with mind.&rdquo; After all, though, as Mr. Frank
Podmore has pointed out, this view rests simply
on a negation&mdash;our present inability to conceive
a thoroughly satisfactory explanation; and
at any time scientific research may remove that
inability, as has happened again and again in the
past in the case of other and seemingly equally
inexplicable phenomena.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all that we, scientists and laymen
alike, need do, is to remember that inability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
explain gives us of itself no warrant to deny. We
must acquaint ourselves with the facts before
accepting or rejecting them. And for myself
I can only say that the actuality of telepathy
has to my mind been absolutely proved. With
Sir Oliver Lodge:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am prepared to confess that the weight of
testimony is sufficient to satisfy my own mind
that such things do undoubtedly occur; that
the distance between England and India is no
barrier to the sympathetic communication of
intelligence in some way of which we are at
present ignorant; that just as a signaling-key in
London causes a telegraphic instrument to respond
instantaneously in Teheran&mdash;which is an
everyday occurrence&mdash;so the danger or death
of a distant child, or brother, or husband, may
be signaled without wire or telegraph clerk, to the
heart of a human being fitted to be the recipient
of such a message.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="f8">CLAIRVOYANCE AND CRYSTAL-GAZING</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> word clairvoyance has acquired a decidedly
sinister meaning in most people&rsquo;s
minds. It is associated with professional spiritistic
mediums, who lay claim to supernatural
powers which they are ready, at a moment&rsquo;s notice,
to exercise for all who are credulous enough
to pay the fee they demand. Newspapers throughout
the country daily contain advertisements of
clairvoyants of this type, arrant humbugs, most
of them, but often able, through cunningly acquiring
information regarding their &ldquo;sitters&rsquo;&rdquo;
lives and family relationships, to persuade their
victims that while &ldquo;entranced&rdquo; they are actually
in contact with the &ldquo;spirit world.&rdquo; Repeated
exposures of their fraudulent methods
have not driven them out of business, but have
inspired a widespread and healthy distrust of
their pretensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it would be rash to conclude, as
many of us do, that there is no such thing as
genuine clairvoyance, by which is meant the
ability to perceive distant scenes and events as
if one were bodily present at the place of their
occurrence. That such a faculty exists, although
usable only on rare occasions, and that
there is nothing in the least supernatural about
it, are facts definitely established by the scientifically
trained investigators who have been diligently
attacking this and other psychical problems
the past twenty-five years. Their researches
have made it evident that in order to explain
genuine clairvoyant phenomena it is not necessary
to postulate the intervention of &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo;
or the flight through space of the clairvoyant&rsquo;s
&ldquo;astral body.&rdquo; At most, clairvoyance is simply
a special form of telepathy, differing in degree
but not in kind from the phenomena discussed in
the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence to justify the
hypothesis of so-called &ldquo;independent clairvoyance,&rdquo;
advocated by occultists of every shade of
spiritistic belief, and utilized by unscrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
tricksters to dazzle the imagination of their
dupes. On the other hand, as I hope to make
convincingly clear, there is plenty of proof that
the scenes which the true clairvoyant perceives,
and is frequently able to describe with graphic
detail, are in reality only mental images, visual
hallucinations, developed by the same process
that enables any ordinary telepathic message to
be apprehended.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, however, that the
telepathic connection is sometimes extremely
difficult to trace; as, for example, in the few
indisputable instances, reported by Professor
James and other trustworthy investigators, in
which the services of clairvoyants have been
successfully invoked to find the bodies of persons
drowned or otherwise accidentally killed under
circumstances seemingly precluding any one from
having knowledge of the place or manner of their
death.</p>

<p>A typical case of the kind occurred a few
years ago in connection with the mysterious death
of a New Hampshire girl, Miss Bertha Huse, of
Enfield, who was drowned in Mascoma Lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>For three days after the disappearance of Miss
Huse, one hundred and fifty of her townspeople
searched vainly for her. She had last been seen
alive on a long bridge crossing the lake, and it
was supposed that she had fallen from it or had
deliberately committed suicide. The waters were
dragged but without result, and failure also
attended the efforts of a professional diver from
Boston employed by a sympathetic citizen.</p>

<p>Meantime, in the little town of Lebanon, some
miles distant, a Mrs. Titus fell into a trance,
during which she talked to her husband and
described to him a spot in the lake where she said
the body of the Huse girl was lying. So strongly
was Mr. Titus impressed by her statements that,
next day, he took her to Enfield, where the diver,
following her instructions, quickly found the
body in the place located by her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Titus afterwards gave other, if less sensational,
demonstrations of a similar character;
and Professor James, who made a close study of
her case, publicly stated his belief that her experiences
form &ldquo;a decidedly solid document in
favor of the admission of a supernormal faculty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of seership&mdash;whatever preciser meaning may
later come to be attached to such a phrase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are also on record certain well-attested
dreams presenting the same difficulty of identifying
the agent, or sender, of the clairvoyant
vision. A characteristic dream of this sort is
reported by Mrs. Alfred Wedgwood, daughter-in-law
of the English savant, Hensleigh Wedgwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spent the Christmas holidays with my
father-in-law in Queen Anne Street,&rdquo; says Mrs.
Wedgwood,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> &ldquo;and in the beginning of January
I had a remarkably vivid dream, which I told to
him next morning at breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed I went to a strange house, standing
at the corner of a street. When I reached the
top of the stairs I noticed a window opposite
with a little colored glass, short muslin blinds
running on a brass rod. The top of the ceiling
had a window veiled by colored muslin. There
were two small shrubs on a little table. The
drawing-room had a bow window, with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
blinds; the library had a polished floor, with
the same blinds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was going to a child&rsquo;s party at a cousin&rsquo;s,
whose house I had never seen, I told my father-in-law
I thought that that would prove to be the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On January tenth I went with my little boy
to the party, and, by mistake, gave the driver a
wrong number. When he stopped at number
twenty, I had misgivings about the house, and
remarked to the cabman that it was not a corner
house. The servant could not tell me where
Mrs. H. lived, and had not a blue-book. Then I
thought of my dream, and, as a last resource, I
walked down the street, looking up for the peculiar
blinds I had observed in my dream. These
I met with at number fifty, a corner house, and,
knocking at the door, was relieved to find that
it was the house of which I was in search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On going up-stairs, the room and windows
corresponded with what I had seen in my dream,
and the same little shrubs in their pots were
standing on the landing. The window in which
I had seen the colored glass was hidden by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
blind being down, but I learned on inquiry that
it was really there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this case the dream, though devoid of any
dramatic feature, served a useful purpose, as
did a much more spectacular dream occurring to
Doctor A.&nbsp;K. Young, an Irish magistrate and
land-owner.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In his dream he suddenly found
himself standing at the gate of a friend&rsquo;s park,
many miles from home. Near by were a group
of persons, one a woman with a basket on her
arm, the rest men, four of whom were tenants of
his own, while the others were unknown to him.
Some of the strangers seemed to be making a
murderous attack on one of his tenants, and he
ran to his rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I struck violently at the man on my left,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;and then with greater violence at the
man to my right. Finding to my surprise that
I did not knock either of them down, I struck
again and again, with all the violence of a man
frenzied at the sight of my poor friend&rsquo;s murder.
To my great amazement, I saw that my arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
although visible to my eye, were without substance;
and the bodies of the men I struck at
and my own came close together after each blow
through the shadowy arms I struck with. My
blows were delivered with more extreme violence
than I think I ever exerted; but I became painfully
convinced of my incompetency. I have no
consciousness of what happened, after this feeling
of unsubstantiality came upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning Doctor Young awoke feeling
stiff and sore, and his wife informed him that
he had greatly alarmed her during the night by
striking out &ldquo;as if fighting for his life.&rdquo; He
then told her of his curious dream, and asked
her to remember the names of the actors in it
recognized by him. The following day he received
a letter from his land agent stating that
the tenant whom he had dreamed he saw attacked
had been found unconscious, and apparently
dying, at the very spot where Doctor
Young had in his dream tried to defend him;
and that there was no clue to his assailants.</p>

<p>That night Doctor Young started for the
scene of the tragedy, and immediately upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
arrival applied to the local magistrate for warrants
for the arrest of the three men whom, besides
the injured tenant, he had recognized in
the vision. All three, when arrested and questioned
separately, told the same story, confirming
the details of the dream, even to the incident
of the presence of the woman with the basket.
They had said nothing about the affair because
they were afraid it would make trouble for them,
but they denied any complicity in it, asserting
that while walking home with them between
eleven and twelve at night, the tenant&mdash;who,
by the way, ultimately recovered&mdash;had been
attacked by a couple of strangers, whose companions
had prevented them from interfering to
protect him.</p>

<p>According to Mrs. Young, it was between
eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock on the night of the
fight that her sleeping husband had frightened
her by his violent actions.</p>

<p>Here the telepathic impulse causing the clairvoyant
dream may have come either from the
injured tenant himself or from one of the three
spectators known to Doctor Young. The difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
is to conceive an adequate reason for any
of them thinking of him, even subconsciously.
But, granting for argument&rsquo;s sake the possibility
of independent clairvoyance, the still more thorny
question at once arises why his &ldquo;astral body&rdquo;
should have chosen to journey to that precise
spot at that precise moment.</p>

<p>The obstacles in the way of such a conception
as independent clairvoyance are too serious to be
overcome. Nor is it necessary to resort to it, in
view of the fact that in the vast majority of
clairvoyant cases it is possible to establish definitely
the telepathic association.</p>

<p>Here, by way of illustration, is a typical case,
fully as impressive as Doctor Young&rsquo;s, but
leaving no doubt as to its origin. It was reported
to the Society for Psychical Research by Mrs.
Hilda West, daughter of Sir John Crowe, who
was at the time British consul general for Norway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father and brother,&rdquo; runs Mrs. West&rsquo;s
narrative, &ldquo;were on a journey during the winter.
I was expecting them home, without knowing
the exact day of their return. I had gone to bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at the usual time, about eleven <span class="f8">P.&nbsp;M.</span> Some time
in the night I had a vivid dream, which made a
great impression on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed I was looking out of a window,
when I saw father driving in a Spids sledge, followed
in another by my brother. They had to
pass a cross-road, on which another traveler was
driving very fast, also in a sledge with one horse.
Father seemed to drive on without observing the
other fellow, who would, without fail, have
driven over father if he had not made his horse
rear, so that I saw my father drive under the
hoofs of the horse. Every moment I expected
the horse would fall down and crush him. I cried
out &lsquo;Father! Father!&rsquo; and woke in a great
fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning my father and brother returned.
I said to them: &lsquo;I am so glad to see you
arrive quite safely, as I had such a dreadful dream
about you last night.&rsquo; My brother said: &lsquo;You
could not have been in greater fright about him
than I was.&rsquo; And then he related to me what
had happened, which tallied exactly with my
dream. My brother in his fright, when he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the feet of the horse over father&rsquo;s head, called
out: &lsquo;Oh, father! Father!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Compare with this the very similar instance of
clairvoyance in a waking or semi-waking state,
experienced by Mrs. Helen Avery Robinson, of
Anchorage, Kentucky, and communicated by
her, with a corroborative letter from her son,
to Professor Hyslop:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son and a friend had driven across the
country to dine and spend the evening with
friends. The rest of the household had retired
for the night. I was awakened by the telephone,
and looked at the clock, finding it eleven-thirty.
I knew my son would soon be in, and thought
of a window down-stairs, which I felt might not
have been locked, and I determined to remain
awake and ask my son to make sure it was secure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I lay waiting and listening for him, I
suddenly saw their vehicle, a light break-cart,
turn over, my son jump out, land on his feet, run
to the struggling horse&rsquo;s head, his friend hold on
to the lines, and in a moment it was gone and
I knew all was right and felt no disturbance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met my son as he came in, and spoke of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
window. He said: &lsquo;We tipped over, mother.&rsquo;
I replied: &lsquo;Yes, I know it. I saw you.&rsquo; And
described what I saw, which he said was just as it
happened. I did not see them before they started
out, as his friend called for him with his horse
and vehicle, so I did not know in what style they
went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It should be added that the spot where the
cart was overturned was so far from the Robinson
house that, even had it been broad daylight,
Mrs. Robinson could not possibly have witnessed
the accident from her bedroom.</p>

<p>In the same way a young man named Frederic
Marks, in Wallingford, Connecticut, clairvoyantly&mdash;and
most dramatically&mdash;beheld an accident
occurring to his brother, Charles, on
Oneida Lake, in New York State, hundreds of
miles from Wallingford.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Charles Marks and
a friend, Arthur Bloom, had gone for a sail on the
lake, were caught in a storm, and almost wrecked
through the giving way of their boom. Charles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
however, springing into the bow, managed to
make the boom fast again, and they succeeded
in running to shore.</p>

<p>It was when their danger was greatest that
they were seen clairvoyantly by Frederic Marks,
who, it being a rainy afternoon in Wallingford,
was lounging in his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think I fell asleep,&rdquo; he testifies,
&ldquo;nor did I seem fully awake. But all at once I
seemed to be facing a severe storm of wind and
rain. As I looked into the storm a small boat
with a sail came, driven helplessly along through
a seething, boiling mass of water. Two young
men were in it, one trying to steer and control
the boat, the other apparently trying to dip out
water and work on the sail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the two, in a moment of greatest
peril, tried to tear down the sail from its mast.
The face of my brother came clearly into view,
with an expression on it that remains with me
now. The boat righted and sped on. I saw a
low shore that it was driving toward. The boat
grew fainter as it neared the shore, and consciousness
came back to me, and, whatever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was, whether a dream or a vision, passed
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately, young Marks did not keep his
singular experience to himself, but hastened
down-stairs and told his employer&mdash;a Mr.
Bristol, with whom he was living&mdash;of what
he had seen. He was laughed at, of course, and
assured that it was &ldquo;only a dream.&rdquo; But three
or four days afterward a letter arrived from
Charles Marks, bringing unexpected verification
of his brother&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>Even more detailed, in point of clairvoyant
perception of a distant scene, is the strange dream
of a physician, Doctor C. Golinski, of Krementchug,
Russia. It was Doctor Golinski&rsquo;s custom
to take a nap during the day, and one afternoon
he lay down on a sofa as usual, about half-past
three. While asleep, he says:<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed that the doorbell rang, and that
I had the usual rather disagreeable sensation
that I must get up and go to some sick person.
Then I found myself transported directly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a little room with dark hangings. To the right
of the door leading into the room is a chest of
drawers, and on this I see a little paraffin lamp
of a special pattern. To the left of the door I
see a bed, on which lies a woman suffering from
severe hemorrhage. I do not know how I come
to know that she has a hemorrhage, but I know
it. I examine her, but rather to satisfy my conscience
than for any other reason, as I know
beforehand how things are, although no one
speaks to me. Afterward I dream vaguely of
medical assistance which I give, and then I
awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then half-past four. About ten minutes
later the doorbell rang, and Doctor Golinski was
summoned to a patient. His surprise may be
imagined when he found that he was ushered
into the identical room of his dream. So astonished
was he that he immediately approached
the bed on which his patient was lying, and said
to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are suffering from a hemorrhage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was her reply, in a tone of great astonishment.
&ldquo;But how do you know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>She then told him, in answer to his questions,
that the hemorrhage had set in about one o&rsquo;clock,
but had not been severe enough to alarm her
until between three and four; and that it was not
until nearly half-past four that she had decided
to send for him.</p>

<p>Nearly every instance of spontaneous clairvoyance
that is sufficiently authenticated to
compel credence, resembles these cases, and the
similarity between them and cases of ordinary
telepathic hallucination, as described in the
chapter on telepathy, is too striking, it seems to
me, to leave any doubt regarding their true
nature. The only points of difference are that
there is a greater amount of detail in clairvoyant
visions, and that the percipient often experiences
a sensation of being actually present at the scene
beheld. But this latter fact is easily comprehensible
when we remember that the same sensation
of &ldquo;otherplaceness&rdquo; is often experienced
in dreams that have no clairvoyant significance,
and experienced with an equal feeling of reality,
dissipated only when the dreamer awakes. As
to the greater amount of detail, it is only necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to assume that in clairvoyant cases the
telepathic action is intensified by some favoring
condition in the percipient&rsquo;s mind, just as some
non-clairvoyant dreams are more detailed and
vivid than others.</p>

<p>Besides which, the telepathic basis of clairvoyance
has been experimentally demonstrated. One
of the investigators for the Society for Psychical
Research, Mr. G.&nbsp;A. Smith, once hypnotized
a lady and requested her to &ldquo;look into&rdquo; the
business office of a friend of his and tell him what
she saw there. Much to his surprise she immediately
began to describe the office with great
exactness, although he was positive she had
never visited it.</p>

<p>It then occurred to him that possibly she was
acquiring her knowledge of it by telepathy from
his own mind, and to test this theory he thought
of an imaginary umbrella, which he pictured to
himself as lying open on his friend&rsquo;s writing table.
In a minute or so, the clairvoyant uttered a cry
of astonishment, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how strange! There&rsquo;s a large umbrella
open on the table!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Usually, however, experiments like this fail,
the entranced clairvoyant being able to discriminate
between the thoughts which correspond to
reality and those which are wholly imaginary.
But that the process involved in clairvoyance is
unquestionably telepathic has been otherwise
proved by the fact that when conditions are
imposed on clairvoyants absolutely excluding
the possibility of thought transference from one
mind to another, they are conspicuously unsuccessful
in their efforts to obtain results. If, as
often happens, they are able to describe distant
places which they have never seen but with
which other persons are necessarily familiar, they
are nevertheless unable to state, for example, the
number on a bank note, chosen at random from
among others and placed in their hands in a
sealed box without anybody previously ascertaining
just what the number is.</p>

<p>Such a test, if successful, would be decisive
proof of independent clairvoyance; but I have
yet to learn of any clairvoyant who has been
able to meet it, although the effort has been frequently
made. It should be pointed out that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in order to give it evidential value, there must
not be the slightest possibility of any one even
glancing at the bank note before it is put into the
sealed box; for, as has already been said, it is
now known that the eye is far keener than we
usually realize, and that the merest glance may
often put us in possession of facts which, sinking
into the memory, may afterward emerge to astonish
and perhaps mystify us. Once they were
lodged in the mind, a clairvoyant could, of course,
obtain these facts from us telepathically, and
thus achieve a seeming success even in the bank
note or some similar test.</p>

<p>Indeed, this power of subconscious perception
is of itself sufficient to explain many undoubtedly
genuine instances of clairvoyance. There is obviously
no need to go beyond it to account for
such a clairvoyant dream as the following, reported
by a lady who has declined to allow her
name to be published:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A number of years ago I was invited to visit
a friend who lived at a large and beautiful country
seat on the Hudson. Shortly after my arrival I
started, with a number of other guests, to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a tour of the very extensive grounds. We walked
for an hour or more, and thoroughly explored the
place. Upon my return to the house, I discovered
that I had lost a gold cuff-stud, which I valued
for association&rsquo;s sake. I merely remembered that
I wore it when we started out, and did not think
of or notice it again until my return, when it was
missing. As it was quite dark, it seemed useless
to search for it, especially as it was the season
of autumn and the ground was covered with
dead leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night I dreamed that I saw a withered
grapevine clinging to a wall, and with a pile of
dead leaves at its base. Underneath the leaves,
in my dream, I distinctly saw my stud gleaming.
The following morning I asked the friends with
whom I had been walking the previous afternoon
if they remembered seeing any such wall and
vine, as I did not. They replied that they could
not recall anything answering the description.
I did not tell them why I asked, as I felt somewhat
ashamed of the dream; but, during the
morning, I made some excuse to go out on the
grounds alone. I walked hither and thither, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
after a long time, I suddenly came upon the
wall and vine exactly as they looked in my
dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not the slightest recollection of seeing
them, or passing by them on the previous day.
The dead leaves at the base were lying heaped
up, as in my dream. I approached cautiously,
feeling rather uncomfortable and decidedly silly,
and pushed them aside. I had scattered a large
number of the leaves when a gleam of gold struck
my eye, and there lay the stud, exactly as in my
dream.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Akin to this is an exceptionally interesting case
that was reported to me by a young lady attending
college at Greeley, Colorado. Her father,
it appears, had sent her a check, which for a day
or two she delayed cashing. Then, being without
money, she looked for it in the place where she
supposed she had put it, but, to her dismay, discovered
that it was not there. A thorough search
of her room failed to bring it to light, and, as it
was not a personal check of her father&rsquo;s, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was greatly worried, thinking that it might be
impossible to duplicate it.</p>

<p>A couple of nights later she had a curious
dream in which she saw herself standing in front
of a bookcase in the college library. On a certain
shelf were five books, one bound in blue, another
in yellow, and between them three with a white
binding. She took down one of the white-covered
volumes, opened it idly, and in the middle of the
book found her check.</p>

<p>Next morning she awoke with no memory of
the dream, nor did she recall it when, later in
the day, she visited the college library and came
across this identical placing of books. It recurred
to her only when she glanced into one of the
white-covered volumes. Feeling rather &ldquo;foolish,&rdquo;
and also not a little apprehensive, she took
down a second volume of the same set, opened
it, and there, sure enough, was the missing check!</p>

<p>She then remembered that the book in which
it was found had been in her room for some hours
the day she received her father&rsquo;s letter. What
happened, I have no doubt, was that she absentmindedly
slipped the check into the book, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
then, so far as her upper consciousness was
concerned, forgot all about it. But subconsciously
she would remember and subconsciously
would be reminded of it the day before the dream
when, in the college library, she happened to see
the same book again, without, perchance, any
conscious knowledge of seeing it. That night,
in sleep, her mind busied itself once more with
the problem of the missing check, this time to
good purpose.</p>

<p>Very similar is a dream for which I am indebted
to Mr. Andrew Lang, who got it from
the dreamer, an English lawyer. This gentleman
had sat up late to write letters, and about
half-past twelve went out to post them. On his
return he missed a check for a large amount received
by him during the day. He searched
everywhere in vain, went to bed, and soon fell
asleep. Then he dreamed that he saw the check
curled around an area railing not far from his
own door. Waking, he was so impressed that,
although it was not yet daylight, he got up,
dressed, walked out of the house, and found the
check at the spot indicated by his dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>In another case a Californian, visiting in
Sullivan County, New York, lost a gold ring
given him by his sister. That night he dreamed
he saw it lying in the sand beneath a swing, in
which he had been sitting in the afternoon. It
was actually there, as he ascertained by looking
next day. Similarly, a clerk in a customs house
recovered a valuable document, the loss of which
would have cost him his position. And the wife
of a clergyman, the Reverend W.&nbsp;F. Brand, of
Emmorton, Maryland, had revealed to her in a
dream the hiding-place of a sum of money which,
six months before, she had put away at her husband&rsquo;s
request, but had afterward accidentally
slipped into a bundle of shawls.</p>

<p>Decidedly, we not only see more than we are
aware of, but we also remember more and for a
far longer time than is usually supposed.</p>

<p>Which brings me to another point of great
importance to the student of clairvoyance and
other psychical problems, and also, as will appear
in a later chapter, of tremendous significance in
affairs of everyday life. The tenacity of memory
is such that nothing one sees is really forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
It merely slips, as it were, into some
subterranean region of the mind, whence, days
and months and even years afterward, it may be
recalled. Of this we have incontrovertible proof
in the phenomena of crystal-gazing, a species
of clairvoyance in which, by gazing into a crystal
or a glass of water, or any small body with a
reflecting surface, it is sometimes possible to
perceive hallucinatory pictures of people and
places situated far beyond the gazer&rsquo;s normal
field of vision, and occasionally depicting events
occurring at the moment they are seen in the
crystal.</p>

<p>Occultists, as will readily be understood, set
great store by crystal-gazing, finding in it positive
proof of spirit action. But again it is unnecessary,
even in the most extraordinary instances recorded,
to adopt any other explanatory hypothesis
than that of telepathy, and in most cases the
source of the visions can be traced directly to
latent memories in the gazer&rsquo;s own mind.</p>

<p>This has been beautifully demonstrated by
Miss Goodrich-Freer, a lady who developed the
faculty of crystal-gazing for the express purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of studying and analyzing its hallucinatory images.
Not everybody, I should perhaps say,
can attain the degree of mental passivity requisite
to seeing pictures in the crystal, but fortunately
for the cause of scientific progress, Miss
Goodrich-Freer was eminently successful.</p>

<p>With the aid of her crystal, Miss Goodrich-Freer
has frequently recalled dates and other
information which she had forgotten and wished
to remember; and on at least one occasion, under
exceptionally peculiar circumstances, she was
enabled to supply an address which was of no
special interest to her, but was of special interest
to a relative. Here is her own account of the
episode:<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;A relative of mine was talking one day with a
caller in the room next to that in which I was
reading, and beyond wishing that they were
<em>farther</em>, I paid no attention to anything they said,
and certainly could have declared positively that
I did not hear a word. Next day I saw in a
polished mahogany table, &lsquo;1, Earl&rsquo;s Square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Notting Hill.&rsquo; I had no idea whose this address
might be; but some days later my relative remarked:
&lsquo;H. (the caller aforesaid) has left Kensington.
She told me her address the other day,
but I did not write it down.&rsquo; It occurred to me
to ask: &lsquo;Was it, 1, Earl&rsquo;s Square?&rsquo; And this
turned out to be the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On another occasion, she says in the long report
she has made on the subject to the Society for
Psychical Research, she saw in the crystal the
picture of a dark-colored wall, covered with
white jessamine. She had been taking a walk
that morning through the streets of London, and
she thought that perhaps the crystal image represented
some spot she had passed in her walk,
though this seemed unlikely, both because she
could not remember having seen such a wall,
and because jessamine-covered walls are by no
means common in London streets. But the next
day she retraced her steps, and presently came
to the identical scene of her crystal vision, the
sight of it bringing the immediate recollection
that at the moment she passed this spot the day
before she had been engaged in absorbing conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
with a friend, and her attention was
wholly preoccupied. The fact, however, of its
reproduction in the crystal made it evident that,
by the subtle power of subconscious perception
she had obtained a perfect mental image of it.</p>

<p>Similarly, while busied one day with household
accounts, she opened the drawer of her writing
table to get her bank-book, and her hand came in
contact with her crystal. Welcoming the suggestion
of a change in occupation, she took it up,
and began to gaze into it. But, she says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Figures were still uppermost, and the crystal
had nothing more attractive to show me than
the combination seven-six-nine-four. Dismissing
this as probably the number of the cab I had
driven in that day, or a chance grouping of the
figures with which I had been occupied, I laid
aside the crystal and took up my bank-book,
which I certainly had not seen for some months,
and found, to my surprise, that the number on
the cover was 7694. Had I wished to recall the
figures, I should, without doubt, have failed,
and could not even have guessed at the number
of digits or the value of the first figure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not surprising to find Miss Goodrich-Freer
adding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, one result of crystal-gazing is to
teach one to abjure the verb &lsquo;to forget&rsquo; in all its
moods and tenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still it is possible that in the act of opening the
drawer, she caught a glimpse, without realizing
it, of the number on the bank-book. There are
many cases, though, in her experience and in the
experience of other crystal-gazers, proving absolutely
that latent memories dating back even to
childhood may be thus recalled; and similar evidence
is forthcoming from hallucinations experienced
without the aid of a crystal. A &ldquo;psychic&rdquo;
with whom Professor Hyslop has often
experimented, and whose home is in Brooklyn,
used to have a recurrent visual hallucination of
a bright blue sky overhead, a garden with a high
fence, and a peculiar chain pump in the garden,
situated at the back of the house.</p>

<p>Some time later she left Brooklyn to pay a
visit to her girlhood home in Ohio, where she met
a lady who invited her to tea. After tea they
went into the garden, and there, to her amazement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
she saw the high fence and the chain pump
of her hallucination. She felt quite sure that
she had never been in the place until that day,
and it looked very much as though she had been
given a supernatural revelation of it. But the
mystery was solved on her return to Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Telling her mother of her odd experience, she
asked if she thought there was any possibility
she could have visited that particular house and
garden in her younger days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; was the unexpected reply. &ldquo;When
you were a little girl, two or three years old, I
often took you to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But not all crystal visions may thus be attributed
to the emergence of subconscious perceptions
or the recrudescence of forgotten memories.
There are some in which the telepathic action of
mind upon mind is clearly manifested, and in
which the crystal seems to serve as a mechanical
aid, enabling the percipient to become aware
of the telepathic message. In no case, however,
as I have already said, is it necessary to go
beyond telepathy to find an adequate explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The same applies to the still more singular
phenomena to which we shall turn next&mdash;the
phenomena of automatic speaking and writing,
regarded by many as affording incontrovertible
proof of the validity of the spiritistic belief that
the dead can and do communicate with the
living.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="f8">AUTOMATIC SPEAKING AND WRITING</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> is a widespread belief that spiritism&mdash;or
spiritualism, as it is more commonly
known&mdash;is on the wane, and will soon be relegated
to the limbo of extinct religions. But the
facts indicate otherwise. At a conservative estimate,
there are to-day, in the United States
alone, no fewer than 75,000 avowed spiritists, in
more or less regular attendance at the meetings
of nearly 450 spiritist societies, and possessing
church property valued at $2,000,000; and more
than 1,500,000 believers who, without openly
identifying themselves with any society, accept
the ministrations of 1,500 public and 10,000
private mediums. Spiritism has even &ldquo;followed
the flag&rdquo; into the Philippines, séances being
held at Manila and elsewhere.</p>

<p>This certainly is a remarkable showing for a
moribund religion, and what makes it more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
remarkable is the fact that spiritism, from its
very beginnings sixty years ago, has been permeated
with fraud. Its founders, the Fox sisters,
daughters of a New York farmer, were naughty
little girls who amused themselves by making
strange noises which superstitious persons interpreted
as communications from the dead. This
proving profitable to the sisters Fox, the business
of producing &ldquo;spirit knockings&rdquo; spread from
town to town, and forthwith modern spiritism
was born. Since then its record has been a long
and dismal catalogue of swindles exposed by
skeptical investigators. Scarcely a month passes
without a story of some sensational exposé; yet,
disproving all predictions to the contrary, spiritism
continues to expand, constantly welcoming
new recruits to its ranks.</p>

<p>Several reasons account for its amazing progress
under what would appear to be the most
adverse conditions imaginable. One is the innate
tendency of many people to dabble with the
occult and mysterious. Another is the appeal
spiritism makes to the most sacred emotions
of humanity. Its central doctrine is that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
possible for the dead to communicate with their
surviving relatives and friends, through the
mediumship of &ldquo;psychics&rdquo; gifted with extraordinary
powers. Thus the hope is raised that
messages of good cheer may be received from
loved ones who have passed to the great Beyond&mdash;that
their voices may be heard, their faces
seen, and their hands clasped by those from
whom death has separated them.</p>

<p>To the spiritistic séance, consequently, go
grief-stricken men and women, skeptical perhaps,
but fervently hopeful that their skepticism will
be overcome. To borrow Professor James&rsquo;s striking
phrase, they are already deeply imbued with
&ldquo;the will to believe,&rdquo; and are in no mood for
close observation of what happens in the séance
room. Usually, to speak plainly, they are utterly
lacking in the qualities that make a scientific
investigator. The sense of their loss is all-absorbing,
and in this state of mind it is easy for
any trickster who poses as a medium to delude
them into fancying that they have actually been
in touch with the dead.</p>

<p>But the main reason why spiritism has survived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
repeated exposés, and persists as a force
to be reckoned with in the religious life of to-day,
is the fact that it is by no means altogether
synonymous with swindling. There are certain
phenomena, particularly so-called automatic
speaking and writing, which it is out of the
question to attribute invariably to trickery and
deceit. While one need have no hesitation in
dismissing as fraudulent<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> all &ldquo;physical&rdquo; mediums&mdash;that
is to say, mediums whose stock in
trade is the production of such phenomena as
the &ldquo;materialization&rdquo; of spirit forms and faces,
the levitation and flinging about of furniture, and
the striking of the &ldquo;sitters&rdquo; by unseen hands&mdash;the
case of the automatists, or &ldquo;psychical&rdquo;
mediums, is decidedly different.</p>

<p>These are mediums who, after passing into a
peculiar condition of trance, and occasionally
while seemingly in their usual waking state, appear
to be controlled by some outside intelligence,
and, when so controlled, utter or write information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which it is hard, if not impossible, to believe
they could have obtained by any ordinary means.
To be sure, there is a host of spurious automatists,
against whom one cannot be too watchfully
on guard. Some of these are out and out cheats,
as brazen as the most rascally materializers.
Some depend for their success on guessing and on
inferences shrewdly drawn from hints unconsciously
dropped by their patrons. Quite a
number, however, undoubtedly seem to exercise
a gift not possessed&mdash;or, at all events, not
utilized&mdash;by everyday men and women.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, in the late nineties, I
visited the spiritist church on Bedford Avenue,
Brooklyn, of which the late Ira Moore Corliss
was then pastor. In his day Mr. Corliss was
probably the most prominent medium in Brooklyn,
a city where spiritism has always flourished.
He was an obviously religious-minded man, and
one who sincerely believed that it was his mission
to act as an intermediary between this world and
the next. That evening the usual order of services
in spiritist churches was followed&mdash;a prayer,
some hymn singing, a sermon, or &ldquo;inspirational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
discourse,&rdquo; and, lastly, the giving of &ldquo;test messages,&rdquo;
in which the medium passed rapidly
up and down the aisles, pausing here and there
to deliver oral communications alleged to come
from the world of spirits.</p>

<p>Seated next to me was an elderly gentleman
of dignified appearance, who watched the proceedings
with a quiet smile of contempt. It was
evident that this was the first time he had ever
seen anything of the kind, and that he was both
amused and disgusted. Suddenly Mr. Corliss,
halting directly in front of him, said, in the quick,
nervous way common to him when under &ldquo;spirit
control&rdquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a message for you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; repeated the elderly gentleman,
incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, for you. There is a spirit here that
wants to thank you for your kindly thought of
him to-day. It is the spirit of a rather tall man,
heavily built, clean-shaven, with bright, tender
eyes. He says his name is Henry Ward Beecher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smile faded from the other&rsquo;s face. He
bent forward, listening intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This spirit,&rdquo; continued the medium, &ldquo;says
that he is glad to know you have not forgotten
him. He says that he was with you this afternoon,
when you went to the cemetery and took
this flower from his grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a dramatic gesture Mr. Corliss drew
from the lapel of his astonished auditor&rsquo;s coat a
sprig of geranium, and held it up so that all could
see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I not right?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are. Quite right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Afterward I joined the elderly gentleman on
the sidewalk, and plied him with questions. I
found him greatly mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too much for me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am
a stranger to Brooklyn, and had never attended
a spiritualist meeting until to-night. I only
dropped in out of curiosity. But it is true that
this afternoon I visited the cemetery where
Henry Ward Beecher is buried, and picked this
flower from near his grave, as a memento of my
visit. Mr. Beecher was a very good friend to
me in my younger days. How the medium could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
know these facts I cannot imagine. I had told
nobody of my trip to the cemetery, and I am
positive that no one saw me pick the flower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On another occasion I took an artist friend to
the first séance he ever attended. The medium
was a psychic of the Corliss type, an automatist
who delivered his &ldquo;spirit messages&rdquo; by word
of mouth. There were perhaps a dozen other
sitters present. To one of these, a thin, gaunt,
haggard-looking young woman, the entranced
medium announced the presence of &ldquo;a spirit
named Wagner.&rdquo; It was none other, it appeared,
than the spirit of the great musician, who promised
he would aid her with her musical compositions.
A smile of infinite content transformed
her careworn features, as she leaned over and
whispered to my friend:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spirit of Liszt is already helping me.
With Wagner&rsquo;s aid I cannot fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One could not smile in face of the story of
boundless faith and pitiful struggle these few
words told. And with the next sitter pathos rose
to positive tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the spirit of a man here, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
name is Frederick,&rdquo; the medium declared, &ldquo;and
he comes to you, madam. Take my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly a woman, dressed in deep mourning,
stood up and extended her hand. Intensity was
written in every line of her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two Fredericks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Which
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Frederick&mdash;it is the Frederick, who,
while on earth, did this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he struck her sharply on the arm. Tears
filled her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I understand.
What does he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this was interesting, but not convincing.
For aught we could tell to the contrary, the
medium had familiarized himself with the life
stories of these women, who doubtless were
regular attendants at his séances. But now he
passed to the friend by my side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A message for you, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from the
spirit of a military-looking man. Yes, he says
that when he was in this sphere he was a commander
of soldiers, a general. This is what he
looks like.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>He launched into a long description, which I
could see was making a profound impression on
my friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he anything particular to say to me?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says that you must on no account decline
the offer that has been made to you to go West&mdash;that
you will never regret going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Less than two hours earlier my companion
had told me of a commission unexpectedly tendered
him, involving a long sojourn in California.
At the medium&rsquo;s words he turned pale, and
glanced around as though half expecting to see
a ghost standing behind his chair.</p>

<p>When the séance had come to an end, and we
were walking home together, he solemnly assured
me that the medium had accurately described a
dead friend, an army officer of the rank of general,
whose advice, had he been alive, he would
have sought with regard to his projected journey
to California.</p>

<p>Again, there is an interesting case reported
from New England by the Reverend Willis M.
Cleaveland. Among Mr. Cleaveland&rsquo;s parishioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
was a young woman, Miss Edith Wright,
who developed mediumistic abilities, being controlled
at times by what purported to be a discarnate
spirit. Dreading notoriety, Miss Wright
gave very few séances, and then only to her
closest friends or to sitters with whom her friends
were well acquainted, and in whose discretion
they could place reliance.</p>

<p>One of these was Mr. Cleaveland, who, being
interested in psychical research, undertook to
obtain, if possible, proof of the identity of the
supposed communicating spirit. If you really
are a spirit, he said in effect, you ought to be
able to give us some facts about yourself, something
about your history while you were on
earth, with data that will enable us to obtain
confirmation of what you say. The &ldquo;control&rdquo;
readily conceded the reasonableness of this, and
in the course of several séances made twenty-six
personal statements, of which the most significant
were:</p>

<p>That her name was Amelia B. Norton.</p>

<p>That she had been the daughter of an orthodox
clergyman, of the &ldquo;water type.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>That she had lived near the Kennebec River,
in the State of Maine.</p>

<p>That when writing letters it had been her custom
to sign herself by the initials N.&nbsp;N., meaning
Nellie Norton.</p>

<p>That she had died in middle life.</p>

<p>That when quite young she had had a love
affair with a Mr. L.&nbsp;C. Brown, who was still
living and engaged in business in Boston, at an
address which the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; gave.</p>

<p>As goes without saying, Mr. Cleaveland at
once wrote to Mr. Brown, and in a few days
received a reply from him, in which he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was out in the town of Sharon very recently,
and called on an elderly gentleman who was a
manufacturer there when I resided there as a boy
in my teens. To my surprise, as we were reviving
old recollections of fifty years ago, he spoke of a
Miss Norton that he said I was sweet on at that
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The facts of the case are that Mary B. Norton,
who always signed herself Nellie B. Norton,
came there, a young miss about my age. We
were, I guess, ardent lovers, but in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
two years I left the town and she did, and I
knew very little of her for a few years after that.
I think it was about five years later that on my
way home from the White Mountains I stopped
off at her home in Maine, which was beside a
large river. I feel sure this was the Kennebec
River. Her father was an orthodox minister, but
I do not understand the meaning of the &lsquo;water
type.&rsquo; I think some two years later she was
residing in Fairhaven and sent me some papers
that contained letters written by Mary B. Norton,
but from that time&mdash;some over forty years&mdash;I
have not seen her. I heard that she died some
years ago, and think she must have been about
fifty years of age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later Mr. Brown wrote again, saying that on
second thought he was not certain that her name
might not have been Amelia instead of Mary,
as he had always known her &ldquo;only as Nellie B.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>It is to the constant occurrence of incidents
like these that the vitality of spiritism is mainly
due. To many people it seems impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
account for such detailed and abundantly corroborated
proofs of personal identity on any hypothesis
short of actual spirit control. Yet in the last
analysis, when viewed in the sober light of latter-day
scientific knowledge of the workings of the
human mind, it will be found that they do not
afford the conclusive demonstration of the validity
of the spiritistic doctrine which on the surface
they appear to yield. For there is always the
possibility&mdash;amounting, I feel warranted in saying,
to certainty&mdash;that what they really indicate
is not communication with the dead, but thought
transference between living minds.</p>

<p>In fact the telepathic connection between the
mind of the medium and the mind of the sitter
is often most obvious. Take the three cases just
cited, and which are typical of mediumistic communications.
The statements made by the
medium Corliss to the friend of Henry Ward
Beecher were statements relating to an incident
fresh in the latter&rsquo;s memory, and therefore easily
obtainable by the telepathic process, which,
there is reason to believe, is exceptionally at the
command of genuine psychics. Likewise, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
artist friend was much occupied mentally with
the problems involved in the California offer,
and was doubtless thinking of it, consciously or
subconsciously, at the time the medium invoked
the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of the army officer whose advice
my friend would have sought had that officer
still been in the flesh. All the medium had to do
was to tap telepathically my friend&rsquo;s subconsciousness
and extract from it every detail of the
&ldquo;revelation&rdquo; so sensationally made to him in
the séance room.</p>

<p>Slightly different, however, is the case of Miss
Edith Wright. Here the facts thought to emanate
from the dead Amelia B. Norton were facts
concerning which Miss Wright&rsquo;s sitter, the Reverend
Mr. Cleaveland, was ignorant. But it is
most significant that, continuing his researches,
Mr. Cleaveland made the discovery that Miss
Norton&rsquo;s old sweetheart, Mr. Brown, had had
at least one sitting with Miss Wright. Mr. Brown
denied that he had ever said anything about
Miss Norton in Miss Wright&rsquo;s presence; but his
memory may have played him false, and, in any
event, she could have got from him by telepathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the data with which she afterward astonished
both him and Mr. Cleaveland. Let me remind
the reader that among the few definitely ascertained
laws of telepathy is the fact that it is
possible for telepathic messages to lie long latent
in the recipient&rsquo;s mind before emerging above
the threshold of consciousness.</p>

<p>This is of even greater significance in connection
with the rarer, but still quite numerous, instances
in which the mediumistic communications
offered as evidence of spirit identity refer
to incidents not known by the medium or by the
sitter or by any previous sitter. These, spiritists
insist, are absolutely inexplicable on the telepathic
basis. I can make their position clearer
by citing an illustrative case taken from the
experience of that greatest of automatists, the
New England medium, Mrs. Leonora E. Piper,
whose remarkable mediumistic faculty was first
made known to the scientific world by Professor
James thirty years ago, and who has since been
repeatedly investigated by leading members of
the Society for Psychical Research. Detectives
have been employed to dog her footsteps, open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
her mail, watch her every move. But not once
have they detected her in fraudulent practices;
and, on the other hand, she has given such convincing
proof of the genuineness of her power
that some of the most skeptical among her investigators
have ended by accepting at face
value her &ldquo;messages from the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On one occasion, while she was being investigated
in England by a committee of experts,
that famous English psychical researcher, Sir
Oliver Lodge, placed in her hands, while she
was entranced, a gold watch once the property
of an uncle of his who had died some twenty
years before. It was now owned by another
uncle, a twin brother of the dead man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told almost immediately,&rdquo; says Sir
Oliver, &ldquo;that it had belonged to one of my
uncles&mdash;one that had been very fond of Uncle
Robert, the name of the survivor&mdash;that the
watch was now in the possession of this same
Uncle Robert, with whom its late owner was
anxious to communicate. After some difficulty
and many wrong attempts, Doctor Phinuit&mdash;a
&lsquo;spirit&rsquo; alleged to be controlling Mrs. Piper&mdash;caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the name Jerry, short for Jeremiah,
and said emphatically, as if impersonating him:
&lsquo;This is my watch, and Robert is my brother,
and I am here. Uncle Jerry, my watch.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this at the first sitting on the very morning
the watch had arrived by post, no one but
myself and a shorthand clerk, who happened
to have been introduced for the first time at this
sitting by me, and whose antecedents were well
known to me, being present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having thus ostensibly got into communication
through some means or other with what
purported to be Uncle Jerry, whom I had indeed
known slightly in his later years of blindness, but
of whose early life I knew nothing, I pointed out
to him that to make Uncle Robert aware of his
presence it would be well to recall trivial details
of their boyhood, all of which I would faithfully
report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He quite caught the idea, and proceeded
during several successive sittings ostensibly to
instruct Doctor Phinuit to mention a number
of little things such as would enable his brother
to recognize him. References to his blindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
illness, and main facts of his life were comparatively
useless from my point of view; but these
details of boyhood, two-thirds of a century ago,
were utterly and entirely out of my ken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Uncle Jerry&rsquo; recalled episodes such as
swimming the creek when they were boys together,
and running some risk of getting drowned;
killing a cat in Smith&rsquo;s field; the possession of a
small rifle, and of a long, peculiar skin, like a
snakeskin, which he thought was now in the
possession of Uncle Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these facts have been more or less completely
verified. But the interesting thing is
that his twin brother, from whom I got the watch
and with whom I was thus in correspondence,
could not remember them all. He recollected
something about swimming the creek, though he
himself had merely looked on. He had a distinct
recollection of having had the snakeskin, and
of the box in which it was kept, though he did
not know where it was then. But he altogether
denied killing the cat, and could not recall Smith&rsquo;s
field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His memory, however, was decidedly failing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
him, and he was good enough to write to another
brother, Frank, living in Cornwall, an old sea
captain, and ask if he had any better remembrance
of certain facts&mdash;of course not giving
any inexplicable reason for asking. The result
of this inquiry was triumphantly to vindicate
the existence of Smith&rsquo;s field as a place near their
home, where they used to play in Barking, Essex;
and the killing of a cat by another brother was
also recollected; while of the swimming of the
creek, near a mill-race, full details were given,
Frank and Jerry being the heroes of that foolhardy
episode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Oliver Lodge himself appears to believe
that he was actually in communication, through
Mrs. Piper, with his dead Uncle Jerry; and by
spiritists generally this is alluded to as a characteristic
instance impossible of explanation on the
theory of telepathy between living minds. But
it is pertinent to point out that possibly, in his
childhood, Sir Oliver may have heard his uncles,
in some moment of reminiscence, discussing these
very incidents. He would naturally have forgotten
the episode, so far as conscious recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of it was concerned; but he would none the less
have retained some memory of their conversation
in his subconsciousness, whence Mrs. Piper
could have gained knowledge of it telepathically.
And, even had he never heard of the incidents,
they might indeed have been transmitted to him
telepathically from the surviving uncles, and been
by him retransmitted to Mrs. Piper.</p>

<p>This last possibility, involving as it does telepathy
between more than two persons, may seem
to be far-fetched. But there is plenty of evidence
that telepathy of this sort&mdash;known technically
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">telepathie à trois</i>&mdash;is an actuality. I
have in mind one particularly interesting case
studied by Mr. Andrew Lang, the brilliant essayist
and psychical researcher. It concerns a
crystal-gazer named Miss Angus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again and again,&rdquo; to give Mr. Lang&rsquo;s own
words, &ldquo;Miss Angus, sitting with man or woman,
described acquaintances of theirs but not of hers,
in situations not known to the sitters but proved
to be true to fact. In one instance, Miss Angus
described doings, from three weeks to a fortnight
old, of people in India, people whom she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
never seen or heard of, but who were known to
her sitter. Her account, given on a Saturday,
was corroborated by a letter from India, which
arrived next day, Sunday. In another case she
described&mdash;about ten <span class="f8">P.&nbsp;M.</span>&mdash;what a lady, not
known to her, but the daughter of a matron
present, who was not the sitter, had been doing
about four <span class="f8">P.&nbsp;M.</span> on the same day. Again, sitting
with a lady, Miss Angus described a singular set
of scenes much in the mind, not of her sitter, but
of a very unsympathetic stranger, who was reading
a book at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried every hypothesis, normal and
not so normal, to account for these and analogous
performances of Miss Angus. There was, in
the Indian and other cases, no physical possibility
of collusion; chance coincidence did not
seem adequate; ghosts were out of the question,
so was direct clairvoyance. Nothing remained
for the speculative theorizer but the idea of cross
currents of telepathy between Miss Angus, a
casual stranger, the sitters, and people far away,
known to the sitters or the stranger, but unknown
to Miss Angus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; adds Mr. Lang, in a paragraph that
every attendant at spiritistic séances would do
well to learn by heart, &ldquo;suppose that Miss
Angus, instead of dealing with living people by
way of crystal-visions, had dealt by way of voice
or automatic handwriting, and had introduced
a dead &lsquo;communicator.&rsquo; Then she would have
been on a par with Mrs. Piper, yet with no aid
from the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That automatists &ldquo;read the mind&rdquo; of their
sitters, or draw upon the contents of their own
subconsciousness in obtaining the facts which
they give out as coming from the spirit world, is
further evident from experiments in automatic
writing conducted by several American and English
psychical researchers.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>But when they are genuine automatists, it
would be unjust to accuse them of conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
deception in attributing their communications to
discarnate spirits. The trance state into which
they usually fall is an abnormal condition, and is
not unlike, if not identical with, the hypnotic
state. As will be shown in detail later, one of the
distinctive characteristics of hypnosis is the
preternaturally increased suggestibility of the
person hypnotized. He will accept and act upon
the slightest suggestion of the hypnotist, no
matter how ridiculous and absurd the suggestion
may be, so long as it is not repugnant to his
moral sense. Moreover, he can be induced to
think that he is some one other than his real
self, and will often assume the traits of the suggested
personality with a fidelity that is astounding.</p>

<p>So, likewise, we must believe, with the automatist,
who will impersonate anybody suggested&mdash;albeit
suggested quite unconsciously&mdash;by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
sitters, whether it be the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of a Greek
philosopher, an Indian chief, or the deceased
friend of some one present. Usually he is so
deeply entranced as to have no knowledge of
what he is doing, just as the hypnotized subject
remains in ignorance of the actions he carries
out in response to the operator&rsquo;s suggestions.
But there is a record of at least one instance in
which the automatist, an amateur psychical researcher
named Charles H. Tout, of Vancouver,
clearly recognized that his various impersonations
were suggested to him by the spectators.</p>

<p>Mr. Tout relates that after attending a few
séances with some friends he felt an impulse to
play medium himself and assume an alien personality.
Yielding to this impulse, he discovered
that, without losing complete control of his consciousness,
he could develop a secondary self
that would impose on the beholders as a discarnate
spirit. On one occasion he thus impersonated
the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of a dead woman, the mother of a
friend present, and his impersonation was accepted
as a genuine case of spirit control. On
another, after having given several successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
impersonations, he suddenly felt weak and ill. At
this point, he states:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the sitters made the remark, which I
remember to have overheard, &lsquo;It is father controlling
him,&rsquo; and I then seemed to realize who I
was and whom I was seeking. I began to be
distressed in my lungs, and should have fallen
if they had not held me by the hands and let me
back gently upon the floor. I was in a measure
still conscious of my actions, though not of my
surroundings, and I have a clear memory of seeing
myself in the character of my dying father
lying in the bed and in the room in which he died.
It was a most curious sensation. I saw his
shrunken hands and face, and lived again through
his dying moments; only now I was both myself&mdash;in
some indistinct sort of way&mdash;and my
father, with his feelings and appearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of which Mr. Tout rightly attributes to
&ldquo;the dramatic working out, by some half-conscious
stratum of his personality, of suggestions
made at the time by other members of the circle,
or received in prior experiences of the kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Add to this the known facts of telepathic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
action, and there is no need of looking further
for a comprehensive explanation of the otherwise
perplexing and supernatural-seeming phenomena
of psychic automatism. This applies even to
the phenomenon of so-called &ldquo;cross-correspondence,&rdquo;
which has been especially stressed the
past few years by certain members of the Society
for Psychical Research as affording proof positive
of survival.</p>

<p>With reference to this particular problem, it
should in the first place be said that, in addition
to Mrs. Piper, there are a number of other automatic
writers who have been similarly investigated
by the Society for Psychical Research for
a long term of years, and whose trustworthiness
has likewise been definitely established. They
include a Mrs. Holland, a Mrs. Forbes, a Mrs.
Thompson, Mrs. Verrall, of Newnham College,
Cambridge, England, and Mrs. Verrall&rsquo;s daughter,
Miss Helen Verrall. Through these ladies
thousands of alleged &ldquo;spirit messages&rdquo; have
been received, including many purporting to
come from Edmund Gurney, Henry Sidgwick,
Frederic Myers, and Richard Hodgson, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
their lifetime were the most active and prominent
members of the Society for Psychical Research.
And among the automatic writings supposed
to emanate from them there have been
not a few so peculiarly conditioned as to suggest
not only that the &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; of the four great
psychical researchers are in touch with their
living friends, but that they are working hard
to devise special tests to prove their identity.</p>

<p>To put the matter more concretely, let me cite
the case of Mrs. Holland. This lady is a resident
of India. In 1893, having seen in the <cite>Review
of Reviews</cite> a reference to automatic writing,
she experimented in it herself, and found that
she possessed the faculty of penning coherent
sentences without being conscious of what she
was writing. She continued these experiments
for ten years, or until 1903, when, after reading
Myers&rsquo;s &ldquo;Human Personality and its Survival of
Bodily Death,&rdquo; she one day discovered that her
automatic writing was seemingly no longer spontaneous,
but controlled by two outside intelligences
that called themselves &ldquo;Myers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Gurney.&rdquo; Each &ldquo;control,&rdquo; alternating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the other, caused her to write long communications,
in which there was mingled with much
that seemed unintelligible and nonsensical long
descriptions of unnamed persons and places.
Her interest aroused, Mrs. Holland collected a
number of these communications and mailed
them to Miss Alice Johnson, Research Officer
of the English Society for Psychical Research.</p>

<p>Examining them carefully, Miss Johnson discovered,
much to her surprise, that they contained
unmistakable references to people and
the homes of people whom Myers and Gurney
had known intimately, but of whom, as Miss
Johnson satisfied herself by searching inquiry,
Mrs. Holland had no knowledge. Thus there
was an excellent description of Mrs. Verrall, her
husband, Dr. A.&nbsp;W. Verrall, and the Verrall
dining-room, in which Myers had often been entertained.
Even the street address of the Verralls
was correctly given. Miss Johnson, as may be
imagined, at once wrote, urging Mrs. Holland
to continue her automatic writing, and to forward
all her script to the offices of the Society. This
was done, with the result that much else of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
seemingly evidential value was soon obtained.
It was especially noted that, although Mrs.
Holland knew nothing of Latin and Greek, her
communications from the Myers control occasionally
contained passages written in both these languages,
with which Myers had been well acquainted.</p>

<p>November 25, 1903, the Gurney control wrote
in the automatic script: &ldquo;Now there is an experiment
I want you to make&mdash;Suggest to the P.&nbsp;R.&mdash;to
Miss J.&mdash;that some one with a trained
will&mdash;she will have no difficulty in finding some
one of the sort&mdash;is to try&mdash;for a few minutes&mdash;every
morning for at least a month&mdash;to convey
a thought&mdash;a phrase&mdash;a name&mdash;anything they
like&mdash;to your mind.&rdquo; In due course this suggestion
was sent by Mrs. Holland to Miss Johnson,
who arranged for a series of such experiments,
with Mrs. Verrall acting as the second
medium.</p>

<p>The experiments began in March, 1905, were
continued until towards the end of May, and
were resumed for a few weeks in the spring of the
following year. The scheme adopted, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was not exactly that suggested by the Gurney
control. Instead of simply attempting to convey
some thought to Mrs. Holland&rsquo;s mind, Mrs.
Verrall, at Miss Johnson&rsquo;s suggestion, wrote
automatically herself on each day that Mrs.
Holland was to write. Neither medium was to
hold the slightest communication with the other,
but both were to forward their automatic scripts
to Miss Johnson as soon as written. In fact, in
order to prevent any loophole for fraud, Miss
Johnson throughout the 1905 experiments kept
Mrs. Holland in ignorance of the identity of her
fellow-experimenter, who, on her side, was ignorant
of Mrs. Holland&rsquo;s real name&mdash;the &ldquo;Holland&rdquo;
being a pseudonym. Some exceedingly
interesting results were secured.</p>

<p>March 1, 1905, Mrs. Holland&rsquo;s script contained
these sentences, &ldquo;There are cut flowers in the
blue jar&mdash;jonquils I think and tulips&mdash;growing
tulips near the window. A dull day, but the sky
hints at spring, and one chirping bird is heard
above the roar of the traffic.&rdquo; In reply to a questioning
letter from Miss Johnson, Mrs. Verrall
wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On March 1 the only cut flowers in my drawing-room
were in two blue china jars on the
mantelpiece; the flowers were large single daffodils.
On the ledge of the window ... were
three pots of growing yellow tulips&mdash;the only
flowers near any window. The day was dull
in the morning, but about twelve the sun came
out and it was warm; it rained heavily in the
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no &ldquo;cross-correspondence&rdquo; in the
writings of the two scripts for this or the next
two weeks&mdash;the experimenters wrote only once
a week&mdash;but in the scripts of the week following
Miss Johnson found a curious coincidence&mdash;the
presence of notes of music. Only once before
or since, she testifies, have notes of music appeared
in the script of either Mrs. Verrall or Mrs.
Holland. In Mrs. Holland&rsquo;s script of that same
date, March 22, there was also a reference to
&ldquo;the ivory gate through which all good dreams
come.&rdquo; Mrs. Verrall, it was learned, on March
19 or 20, had been reading Virgil&rsquo;s passage in
the &ldquo;Æneid&rdquo; about the gates of horn and ivory.
She had been reading Dante, too, in the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Italian, the first time she had read anything in
Italian for months; and, oddly enough, Mrs.
Holland&rsquo;s script for March 22 contained a sentence
in Italian.</p>

<p>Later scripts were characterized by even more
striking correspondences, and&mdash;which is not
without interest&mdash;on more than one occasion
the &ldquo;controls&rdquo; issued warnings against placing
faith in Eusapia Paladino. For instance, on
December 1, 1905, the Myers control wrote
through Mrs. Holland: &ldquo;There may be raps
genuine enough of their kind&mdash;I concede the
raps&mdash;poltergeist merely&mdash;but the luminous
appearances&mdash;the sounds of a semi-musical nature&mdash;the
flower falling upon the table&mdash;trickery&mdash;trickery.&rdquo;
And the Gurney control added:
&ldquo;Her feet are very important&mdash;Next time can&rsquo;t
Miss J. sit with the sapient feet both touching
hers&mdash;Let her fix her thoughts on the feet and
prevent the least movement of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As American investigators have since discovered,
Eusapia&rsquo;s feet are indeed important.</p>

<p>These first experiments were followed by others,
in which, besides Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
all four of the other mediums mentioned above
took part, and again suggestive cross-correspondences
were secured. Besides which, having been
induced by the results of the Verrall-Holland
experiments to study more closely earlier scripts
stored in the Society&rsquo;s archives, Miss Johnson
discovered what seemed to be similar cross-correspondences
that occurred before any experiments
of this kind were undertaken. I can
give only one or two illustrations. August 28,
1901, Mrs. Forbes wrote a message purporting
to come from her dead son Talbot, to the effect
that he had to leave her in order to control another
&ldquo;sensitive,&rdquo; and through her obtain corroboration
of Mrs. Forbes&rsquo;s own automatic writing.
On the same day Mrs. Verrall wrote in Latin of a
fir tree planted in a garden, and the script was
signed with a sword and a suspended bugle.
The latter was part of the badge of the regiment
to which Talbot Forbes had belonged, and Mrs.
Forbes had in her garden some fir trees grown
from seed sent to her by her son. These facts,
according to Miss Johnson, were unknown to
Mrs. Verrall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>In another case Mrs. Forbes wrote, on November
26 and 27, 1902, references, absolutely meaningless
to herself, to a passage in a book which
Mrs. Verrall had been reading on those days;
and the references also applied appropriately to
an obscure sentence in Mrs. Verrall&rsquo;s own script
of November 26.</p>

<p>But undoubtedly the most impressive cross-correspondences
were obtained in a series of experiments
extending from November, 1906, to
June, 1907, and involving concordant automatism
between Mrs. Holland, in India, and Mrs.
Piper, Mrs. Verrall, and Miss Verrall, in England.
A full report on this series is given in the
October, 1908, issue of the Society&rsquo;s <cite>Proceedings</cite>.
The plan followed was to suggest to the controls
of Mrs. Piper&mdash;in her case the alleged &ldquo;spirits&rdquo;
of Myers, Sidgwick, and Hodgson&mdash;that they
transmit to one or more of the other automatists
some test word or message. There were many
failures, but there were also many seeming successes.</p>

<p>January 16, 1907, the Myers control promised
that it would, as a proof of its identity, cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall to sign a piece
of automatic writing with a triangle drawn within
a circle. A circle with a triangle inside it actually
appeared in Mrs. Verrall&rsquo;s script of January 28,
while a script from Mrs. Holland exhibited several
geometrical figures, including a circle with a
triangle outside it. February 6 the same control
said that it had just been referring, through Mrs.
Verrall, to a &ldquo;library matter,&rdquo; and investigation
showed that half an hour earlier Mrs. Verrall,
writing at her home in Cambridge, had begun a
script in which the word &ldquo;library&rdquo; occurred
three times&mdash;the only time during the period
of the experiments that &ldquo;library&rdquo; was mentioned
in her automatic writing or in Mrs. Piper&rsquo;s
trance statements. The Myers control again, on
February 11, announced that it had given &ldquo;hope,
star, and Browning&rdquo; to Mrs. Verrall, and her
script showed that this was correct. February 12
the Hodgson control declared it had been trying
to impress the word &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; on Mrs. Verrall.
Her script for the previous day, when received
at the Society&rsquo;s offices in London, proved to be
decorated with a drawing of three arrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the multiplicity of coincidences like these&mdash;and
I have given only the merest fragment
of the evidence in hand&mdash;that has recently persuaded
many hitherto hesitating psychical researchers,
notably Sir Oliver Lodge, that scientific
proof of spirit communication has veritably been
obtained. For myself, I must frankly say, however,
that I cannot accept this view of the case.
Fraud, I admit, is out of the question as an explanatory
hypothesis. Nor does it seem possible
to explain away the evidence on the theory of
mere chance, guessing, &ldquo;lucky hits,&rdquo; etc. But
there remains the hypothesis of telepathy between
living minds; and, as it seems to me, there
is nothing whatever in the evidence presented
incompatible with the view that the cross-correspondences
in question resulted from direct
thought transference between the automatists
themselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="f8">POLTERGEISTS AND MEDIUMS</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> have now to consider a very different
class of spiritistic manifestations, the so-called
&ldquo;physical phenomena,&rdquo; which are historically
among the earliest on record, and at the
same time are far more spectacular and sensational
than the phenomena produced by the
automatic speakers and writers. They include
such weird occurrences as the appearance in the
séance room of ghostly forms alleged to be spirits
&ldquo;materialized&rdquo; by the power of the medium;
the lifting of the latter from the floor by an invisible
force; the touching, pinching, and striking
of the sitters by unseen hands, and the movement
of small articles of furniture as though alive.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when the medium is particularly
gifted, still more striking happenings take place.
Thus, at a séance with Eusapia Paladino, attended
by such eminent scientists as Professors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Lombroso, Bianchi, Tamburini, Vizioli, and Ascensi,
men whose veracity is beyond question, it
is recorded by Lombroso<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw a great curtain, which separated our
room from an alcove adjoining, and which was
more than three feet distant from the medium,
suddenly move out toward me, envelop me, and
wrap me close. Nor was I able to free myself
from it except with great difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dish of flour had been put in the little
alcove room, at a distance of more than four and
a half feet from the medium, who, in her trance,
had thought, or, at any rate, spoken, of sprinkling
some of the flour in our faces. When light was
made, it was found that the dish was bottom side
up, with the flour under it. This was dry, to be
sure, but coagulated, like gelatine. This
circumstance seems to me doubly irreconcilable&mdash;first,
with the laws of chemistry, and, second,
with the power of movement of the medium, who
had not only been bound as to her feet, but had
her hands held tight by our hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the lights had been turned on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
we were all ready to go, a great wardrobe that
stood in the alcove room, about six and a half
feet away from us, was seen advancing slowly
towards us. It seemed like a huge pachyderm
that was proceeding in leisurely fashion to attack
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other investigators, men of equally high character,
report marvels no less amazing. On one
occasion, Eusapia Paladino is credited with
having created an invisible man, a being which
the sitters could distinctly feel, although they
could not see it, and which, annoyed by their
inquisitive prodding, finally turned on one of
them and bit him in the thumb. For this we have
the authority of Professors Morselli and Barzini,
the latter being the investigator whose thumb
was bitten.</p>

<p>Again, two English noblemen, Lords Dunraven
and Crawford, affirm that they several times
saw another medium, the late D.&nbsp;D. Home, floating
through the air; once at a height of more than
seventy feet above the ground; and that the
same medium, by some &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; agency, was
elongated in full view of them, so that they beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
his stature visibly increase, to decrease again to
normal height only when he came out of the
trance condition.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; that perform
these uncanny feats have a strong liking for
darkness, a circumstance which has led to wholesale,
and repeatedly substantiated, accusations
of fraud. In fact, there is no other department
of spiritism to which the taint of fraud has so
thoroughly attached itself. It is obvious that
any clever charlatan, by persuading his sitters
that darkness is necessary for the development
of occult phenomena, can produce most mystifying
effects, and the records of scientific investigations,
to say nothing of the records of our
police courts, abound in evidence that swindlers
have not been slow in availing themselves of
this opportunity to prey on the credulous and
superstitious. The lengths to which bogus mediums
will sometimes go, and the extreme gullibility
which renders their operations ridiculously
easy and highly profitable, are amusingly illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
by a story told by Mr. Hereward Carrington,
an investigator who has done much to
make the public acquainted with the ways of
fraudulent &ldquo;psychics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of these, according to Mr. Carrington, had
among his patrons an elderly business man, the
head of a large concern that manufactured farming
implements. After several months of intercourse,
during which the medium deftly led him
on from marvel to marvel, until at last there was
no &ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo; too incredible for him to
swallow, he was informed that at the next séance
he would have the unique experience of conversing
with the spirit of a deceased inhabitant of
the planet Jupiter.</p>

<p>Sure enough, after the lights had been carefully
turned low, he was accosted by a tall, shadowy
figure, which announced itself as a spirit from
Jupiter, and which, speaking excellent English,
proceeded to describe the conditions of life in
that far-off sphere. The Jupiterians, it appeared,
were a poor, ignorant lot, scarcely removed from
barbarism; they were greatly in need of civilization,
and any one who should help in civilizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
them would be generously rewarded in the future
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to do all in my power,&rdquo; the
business man eagerly volunteered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid there&rsquo;s nothing I could do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, there is. I understand that you
make farm implements and machinery. Well,
they haven&rsquo;t as much as a spade on Jupiter.
If you would send a few tools there, it would be a
great step toward civilizing them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how in the world could I get anything
to them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite simple,&rdquo; the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; glibly
explained. &ldquo;Just send the things to the medium
here, and he will dematerialize them and ship
them to Jupiter, where they will be rematerialized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of seeing in this a daring attempt to
fleece him, the victim joyfully acquiesced, and
sent a number of spades, plows, harrows, etc.,
to the medium, who promptly disposed of them,
not to the people of Jupiter, but to a dealer in
such articles. Other séances followed, the spirit
from Jupiter again appearing and describing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
picturesque language the beneficent consequences
of the welcome presents. This meant more gifts,
which steadily increased in number and value,
until the confederate who had been playing the
part of the dead Jupiterian finally became frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he told the medium, &ldquo;this has
got to stop. It was all very well when you were
satisfied with plows, and rakes, and little things
like that, but now that you have got him giving
you horses and harvesters there&rsquo;s bound to be
trouble. He&rsquo;s sure to find out in the end, and
some fine morning we&rsquo;ll wake up on the inside of a
jail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said the medium. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
never find out anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain of that. At any rate,
you&rsquo;ll have to get somebody to take my place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One word led to another, and ended in a violent
quarrel. The confederate, vowing vengeance,
called on the business man, and told him how he
had been duped. He was met with the astonishing
reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send
the medium, only yesterday, a horse and cart to
be dematerialized?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you wish to know where they are,
come with me. He has them in a stable near his
house, waiting to find a buyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Together they went to the stable, where the
confederate pointed out the horse and cart that
had been given to the medium. In particular,
he identified the cart by the number painted on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t deny that&rsquo;s
your cart, can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;it does indeed look
like my cart. But I know it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know it isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;in a tone of solemn conviction&mdash;&ldquo;I
know that by this time my cart is on
Jupiter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another case, drawn to my attention by a
lawyer friend, the victim was a well-to-do Boston
merchant, who had become interested in spiritism
shortly after the death of his wife, to whom he had
been devotedly attached, and with whose spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
he hoped to be brought into communication. A
medium, learning this, determined to profit from
his grief and longing, and hired a young woman
to pose as the spirit of the dead wife. He was
then told that before long it would be possible to
&ldquo;materialize&rdquo; his wife from the spirit world
with such substantiality that he would be able
to clasp her in his arms.</p>

<p>When the appointed time came, a slender form,
draped in gauze, emerged from the mediumistic
cabinet into the darkened séance room, and
saluted him with a joyful cry of &ldquo;Husband!&rdquo;
There was not light enough to see the &ldquo;spirit&rsquo;s&rdquo;
face, but he did not for an instant doubt that he
was really gazing at his wife, and rose to embrace
her. At once the figure vanished, and after the
lights were turned up the medium explained that
there would have to be a good many &ldquo;materializations&rdquo;
before the spirit form would be solid
enough for him to touch it.</p>

<p>This meant, of course, numerous séances, for
which the deluded husband paid handsomely.
It also helped to blind him to the true state of
affairs, and increased his infatuation to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
extent that when at length the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; submitted
to his caresses, it did not seem at all
incongruous to find that he was pressing to his
breast a flesh-and-blood woman.</p>

<p>The medium now resolved on a bold stroke.
Acting under her instruction, the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; bitterly
complained one evening that she did not
possess any jewelry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; her &ldquo;husband&rdquo; exclaimed. &ldquo;Do
you mean to say that they wear jewelry in the
other world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But nothing to compare with
what I had while on earth. What have you done
with mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it all&mdash;every piece&mdash;put away in a
little box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Then if you will bring it to-morrow
night, I can take it with me when I leave you.
The medium, you know, can dematerialize it for
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will bring it. Rest assured of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas for husbandly devotion! The séance at
which he turned over the jewelry to the affectionate
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of his wife was the last at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he held communion with her. When he next
called, he was told that the medium had been
unexpectedly summoned out of town. She never
came back.</p>

<p>These two episodes are typical rather than
exceptional instances of the sort of thing that
has been going on for years in connection with the
physical phenomena of spiritism. Its continuance
has been made possible largely by a widespread
belief, entertained not by the ignorant and superstitious
merely, but by men of distinction in the
intellectual and scientific world, that, notwithstanding
the prevalence of fraud, there are at
least some physical phenomena which must be
accounted genuine.</p>

<p>Men like the Italian savants already named,
the English naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace;
the great chemist, Sir William Crookes; the
French astronomer, Camille Flammarion, and
many others who might be mentioned, are
satisfied that they have witnessed in the
séance room occurrences out of all accord
with natural laws, and not to be attributed to
fraud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>In support of this view, emphasis is laid on
the fact that, leaving out of consideration all
mediums who employ their powers as a means of
livelihood, physical phenomena of the most
bizarre sort have been manifested through men
and women in private life, who cannot possibly
have a pecuniary motive for deception, and
whose character is beyond reproach.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated of physical mediums,
in fact, was a clergyman of the Church of England,
the Reverend W. Stainton Moses, a gentleman
respected and warmly esteemed by all who
knew him.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>As a further argument in behalf of the authenticity
of certain of the phenomena, attention is
also called to the interesting circumstance that,
long before spiritism and spiritistic mediums
were heard of, similar marvels&mdash;including seemingly
spontaneous movements of furniture, and
the occurrence of mysterious raps, knockings,
and other noises&mdash;were frequently reported by
thoroughly reputable witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>To mention only a few cases,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> as long ago as
1661 there was an outbreak of this kind at the
home of a wealthy Englishman named Mompesson,
an invisible ghost for months disturbing
the peace of the Mompesson family by beating
on a drum, banging at doors, tugging at bedclothes,
and hurling household articles about in
a most destructive manner. The affair made so
much stir that a royal commission was sent to
inquire into it, but signally failed to lay the
ghost. For nearly a year, in 1716-1717, the
Reverend Samuel Wesley, father of the founder
of Methodism, was tormented in like fashion at
his rectory in Lincolnshire. In 1753 a Russian
monastery was invaded by an equally malicious
and equally invisible &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; which for months
amused itself by ringing the monastery bells at
unseemly hours. Nine years later all London
was thrilled by the celebrated Cock Lane ghost,
which produced spirit rappings with as much
éclat as the most up-to-date, medium-invoked
visitant from &ldquo;the other side.&rdquo; In none of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
instances did contemporary investigators find a
wholly satisfactory explanation for the singular
phenomena involved.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it may confidently be affirmed
that, instead of strengthening the case for the
physical phenomena of spiritism, the doings of
the poltergeists&mdash;as these tricky ghosts are
called by psychical researchers&mdash;considerably
weaken it. For during recent years a number of
poltergeist hauntings have been looked into by
members of the Society for Psychical Research,
and whenever the conditions have been such as
to permit a thorough investigation, it has been
found that, so far from being spiritual entities,
poltergeists are invariably compounded of deceit,
credulity, and delusion. Even more important,
from the standpoint of getting at the true inwardness
of physical mediumship, the discovery has
been made that fraud has frequently been practised
in poltergeist cases without any apparent
motive.</p>

<p>Again I will give an instance from actual occurrence,
in order to make my meaning perfectly
clear. Word was one day received at the London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
offices of the Society for Psychical Research that
a ghost had taken possession of a farmhouse in
Shropshire, and was making life miserable for the
lawful occupants, a family named Hampson and
their two maidservants, Priscilla Evans and
Emma Davies. Nobody saw the ghost, but it
made its presence felt in true poltergeist style.</p>

<p>It had announced its advent, about four o&rsquo;clock
one fine afternoon, by lifting a saucepan from the
kitchen fire and throwing it across the room, picking
red-hot coals out of the fire and scattering
them over the floor, and by causing a lamp globe
to fly miraculously through the air. This last
prank, naturally enough, so frightened the
Hampsons and their servants that they fled from
the house, and summoned aid from the nearest
neighbors, among them a Mr. Lea, who, in the
report that reached the Society for Psychical
Research,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> declared that when he approached the
Hampson homestead, it seemed as if all the upstairs
rooms were on fire, &ldquo;as there was such a
light in the windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Reënforced, the Hampsons made bold to enter
the house again, but the poltergeist had seemingly
formed a strong dislike to them, for the
report added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As things were continuing to jump about the
kitchen in a manner which was altogether inexplicable,
and many were getting damaged, Hampson
decided to remove everything out of the
apartment. He accordingly took down a barometer
from the wall, when something struck him
on the leg, and a loaf of bread, which was on
the table, was thrown by some invisible means,
and hit him on the back. A volume of &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress&rsquo; was thrown, or jumped, through the
window, and a large, ornamental sea-shell went
through in similar fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the parlor a sewing machine was thrown
about and damaged. The nurse girl was nursing
the baby by the fire when some fire leaped from
the grate, and the child&rsquo;s hair was singed and
its arms burned. The girl was so alarmed that
she set off to a neighbor&rsquo;s, and on the way there
her clothes took fire, and had to be torn from her
body. During the evening, while the girl was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
at the neighbor&rsquo;s, a plate, which she touched while
having her supper, was repeatedly thrown on the
floor, and the pieces were picked up by some unseen
agency, and put in the center of the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the girl&rsquo;s return to the Hampson place the
manifestations broke out anew. Mr. and Mrs.
Lea were strongly of the opinion that they were
the work of the devil; the Hampsons, however,
inclined to the view that the blame lay at the door
of some evil spirit that was especially desirous of
tormenting the nurse girl, Emma Davies, it being
noticed that things quieted down whenever she
was out of the house. On this theory they sent
her to her home in a neighboring village, where
the poltergeist continued to annoy her. In the
presence of a police officer, watching her closely
to detect evidence of fraud, it wrenched the
buttons from her dress and ripped out the stitches
of her apron. While the village schoolmistress
and some twenty other people looked on, it twice
drew off her shoes and tossed them to the opposite
side of the room; and it was said to have afterward
lifted her bodily from the floor, and held
her suspended in mid-air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Clearly, this was a case calling for investigation,
and the Society for Psychical Research at
once commissioned one of its expert detectives
of the supernatural, Mr. F.&nbsp;S. Hughes, to proceed
to the scene of the disturbances. But before he
arrived, the mystery was solved. The girl, it
seems, had been made so nervous and excited
by the unwelcome attentions of the poltergeist
that it was thought best to place her in a physician&rsquo;s
care, and she was accordingly taken to a
sanitarium and kept in strict seclusion, under the
constant observation of the physician&rsquo;s housekeeper,
Miss Turner, a shrewd, level-headed
woman. For three days, the poltergeist continued
to plague her. Then it suddenly took its departure,
under the following circumstances, narrated
by Mr. Hughes in his official report:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday morning Miss Turner was in an
upper room at the back of the house, and the
servant of the establishment and Emma Davies
were outside, Emma having her back to the
house, and unaware that she was observed. Miss
Turner noticed that she had a piece of brick in
her hand, held behind her back. This she threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to a distance by a turn of the wrist, and, while
doing so, screamed to attract the attention of
the servant, who, of course, turning round, saw
the brick in the air, and was very much frightened.
Emma Davies, looking round, saw that she had
been seen by Miss Turner, and, apparently imagining
that she had been found out, was very
anxious to return home that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Turner took no notice of the occurrence
at the time, but the next morning she asked the
girl if she had been playing tricks, and the girl
confessed that she had, and went through some
of the performances very skillfully, according to
Miss Turner&rsquo;s account. Later on in the day she
repeated these in the presence of the doctor,
Miss Turner, and two reporters from London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obviously, trickster though she was, the girl
had no rational motive for her conduct. It had
already cost her a good position, and rendered it
most unlikely that she would easily get another.
And, in fact, this same absence of motive is
conspicuous in nearly all the poltergeist cases
exposed by the Society for Psychical Research,
and by independent investigators. It is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
noteworthy that when discovery is made, the
active agent is usually found to be a boy or girl,
man or woman, constitutionally or temporarily
in an abnormal nervous condition.</p>

<p>In this particular case, for instance, the girl,
Emma Davies, on the testimony of her mother,
was subject to &ldquo;fits.&rdquo; In another case, investigated
by the Society, the poltergeist was definitely
identified with a little deformed girl, twelve
years old, of decidedly abnormal characteristics.
In a third case, investigated by Mr. Frank
Podmore, another member of the Society and a
specialist on poltergeists, a confession of fraud
was elicited from a neurotic boy of fifteen&mdash;a
confession only partial, it is true, but in one sense
more illuminating than any full confession would
have been. The case is so instructive, both for
its revelation of the almost incredible credulity
of many devotees of spiritism, and for the light
it throws on the problems of physical mediumship,
that I quote it, condensed, from Mr. Podmore&rsquo;s
detailed review of his investigation.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the autumn of 1894,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;Mrs. B.,
a lady living in a provincial town, gave me an
account of certain curious incidents which had
recently taken place in her house. The occupants
of the house&mdash;an old one&mdash;consisted,
besides Mrs. B. and her family, of a widow lady,
Mrs. D., and her two children, a girl of about
twenty, C.&nbsp;D., and a boy of fifteen, E.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. B., C.&nbsp;D., and E.&nbsp;D. had been in the
habit of trying experiments with planchette in
the evening. Planchette had given them to
understand that the house was haunted by four
spirits, a wicked marquis, a wicked monk, a lay
desperado, and a virtuous and beautiful young
lady. These spirits wrote, through planchette,
of treasure concealed in the house, of a hidden
chamber, and many other matters. Among other
proofs were the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One evening after dark, Mrs. B., in accordance
with directions received through planchette,
went with C.&nbsp;D. and E.&nbsp;D. to an old oak tree in
the garden, and, standing with the girl and boy
on either side, holding a hand of each, she distinctly
heard a stone strike the garden roller a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
few feet off. The phenomenon was repeated
twice; and her companions solemnly assured
her that they had no part in the performance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On another occasion, sitting in a bedroom
in the dark, with only E.&nbsp;D. in the room, Mrs. B.
was struck by a stone on the temple, heard objects
thrown about the room, felt an arm put through
hers, and so on. Some of these phenomena occurred
when she was alone in the room&mdash;but
with the door, I gathered, not shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. B. one morning placed a white chrysanthemum
bouquet on the boughs of the oak tree.
It disappeared shortly afterward, and on the
next morning two other small bouquets were
found there. Mrs. B. asked for whom these were
intended, and went away, leaving pencil and
paper. On her return she found the paper torn
in half, and the initials of her own Christian
name, and that of C.&nbsp;D., written on the two
halves respectively, with a bouquet on each half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this time a secret chamber was discovered
with the skeleton of a cat crouching
in act to spring, and the skeleton of a woman.
Asked more particularly about the latter, Mrs. B.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
said: &lsquo;Well, at least a skull and some bones&mdash;but
it was a woman&rsquo;s skull.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days after receiving this account, I
went down by invitation to the house. I saw
Mrs. D. and her two children, and received from
them ungrudging corroboration of Mrs. B.&rsquo;s
marvelous story. In E.&nbsp;D.&rsquo;s company I penetrated
the secret chamber, and found there the
mummified skeleton of what might have been a
cat&mdash;but nothing else. In removing the stains
left by this exploit, I contrived a tête-à-tête interview
with E.&nbsp;D., and asked him: &lsquo;How much
did you do of all these things?&rsquo; He replied:
&lsquo;Oh, not much. I only did a few little things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pressed on particular points, he admitted
having thrown <em>one</em> stone at the garden roller, and
having also thrown a trouser button against the
wall when sitting alone in the bedroom with
Mrs. B. He denied having produced the other
phenomena on those occasions. Asked as to the
bouquets, he said he had not placed them on
the tree. Pressed a little more, he said: &lsquo;If I
did it, it must have been without knowing it.&rsquo;
This without any suggestion from me as to possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
somnambulism, or unconscious action. He
assured me that his sister had had no hand in this
matter. I could not get any more out of him, as
he was shortly after called away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I subsequently learned from his mother that
E.&nbsp;D. was so nervous and delicate that he slept
in her room at night; that he was not allowed
to do much mental work; that he was subject
to attacks of somnambulism; and had, indeed,
fallen into a semiconscious state only a few days
before, during a lesson in carpentry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably the whole affair originated in a
moment of mischief, and was carried on and
elaborated because of an uncontrollable, and
perhaps not entirely conscious, desire on the
part of the abnormally conditioned lad to mystify
the too easily imposed upon elderly lady.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the investigations of the Society
for Psychical Research make it certain
that in nine cases out of ten a poltergeist is a
by-product of hysteria, using the term in its
strictest medical sense. As is well known, one
of the distinctive symptoms of hysteria is a tendency
to indulge in all manner of lies and deceptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
coupled often with almost diabolical cleverness
in giving these lies and deceptions a color
of reality. Impulse to such trickery may arise
from a great variety of motives; frequently, it
would seem, from nothing more than an abnormal
craving for notoriety and admiration. Certainly,
the hysterical young people run to earth
by the poltergeist hunters of the Society for
Psychical Research did not engage in their hoaxings
because they expected to make money out
of them.</p>

<p>The bearing of all this on the physical phenomena
of spiritism is surely self-evident. It
shows, for one thing, that the money motive
is not the only motive inciting mediums to fraud;
that when a neurotic or hysterical condition is
present, the best of characters is no guarantee
against duplicity; and that under such circumstances
the detection of fraud is exceedingly
difficult, particularly in the case of witnesses predisposed
to regard the phenomena as genuine.
If hysterical children can, as they have often
done, carry on a course of deception mystifying
a whole community, it is manifest that mediums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of similar hysterical tendencies, working under
cover of darkness or in a dim light, can more or
less readily deceive the most expert observers;
and, moreover, that they may be only partially,
if at all, conscious of their own frauds.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Further, in estimating the nature of the phenomena
produced at the séances of physical
mediums, it is imperative to take into account
the innumerable possibilities of mal-observation
on the part of the spectators. Experience has
shown that comparatively few people, no matter
how honest, are trustworthy witnesses even when
conditions for observation are of the best.</p>

<p>For proof of this, one does not need to look
beyond the courtroom, where every day perfectly
honest people give the most contradictory
accounts of some simple occurrence. If it is thus
difficult to see correctly what goes on in the
broad light of day, it surely is far more difficult
to be certain of exactly what is happening in a
room where there is darkness rather than light.
Besides which, the imaginative faculty may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
excited to such an extent that the sitters at a
séance may not only be misled into making inaccurate
reports of what really occurred, but they
may even, and with absolute sincerity, testify
to phenomena which did not occur at all.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, now a physician in Maryland,
used to amuse himself in his student days by
playing medium at table-tipping séances. He
would cause the table to rap out messages to
various acquaintances of his, none of whom were
spiritists, but several of whom became intensely
interested, owing to their inability to fathom the
source of the communications they received, my
friend managing things so skillfully that they did
not suspect him of hoaxing them.</p>

<p>One evening the table announced the presence
of the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of a little child, the daughter of a
lady well known to most of the sitters. They
were not aware, however, that my friend was
intimately acquainted with the little one&rsquo;s life
history, and when, utilizing this knowledge, he
proceeded to make the table rap communications
of a most personal character, there was considerable
excitement. Suddenly a lady present, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a relative of the dead child, uttered a piercing
scream, and fainted.</p>

<p>When she was revived, she declared, with
emphatic assurance, that she had seen the head
of a child emerge from the center of the table.</p>

<p>Equally indicative of the part imagination
plays in constructing spiritistic phenomena is
an experience of my own with a New York medium.
His specialty was materialization, but at
the séance in question he did not attempt to
develop &ldquo;spirit forms&rdquo; by any of the methods
in vogue among materializers. Instead, the gas
having been lowered until the room was almost in
total darkness, he went into a &ldquo;trance,&rdquo; and,
seated at the séance table, with his head resting
on his hands, declaimed in a singsong voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spirits are coming. I can feel them approaching.
You will be able to see them soon.
They are almost here. Here is one now, on my
left. Can&rsquo;t you see it? And here comes another,
and another. They are crowding around me, so
anxious to communicate with you. Can&rsquo;t you
see them? I can&rsquo;t hold them long; they will be
gone soon. Oh, can&rsquo;t you see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>There were, perhaps, a dozen people present,
including myself and a fellow investigator, who
had accompanied me. Of the others, three responded
to the hypnotic suggestiveness of the
medium&rsquo;s words and manner, and solemnly declared
that they could see a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; hovering
about him. One lady, whose integrity I could
not doubt, insisted that she saw two &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo;
which she identified as her dead husband and
brother.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, therefore, it is proper to assume
that when, in the instances cited at the beginning
of this chapter, Professor Lombroso, sitting with
Eusapia Paladino, saw a huge wardrobe advance
to attack him; and when Lords Crawford and
Dunraven saw the medium Home floating through
the air, hallucination rather than &ldquo;spirit action&rdquo;
is the correct explanation. At all events, in
view of the known fallibility of the human senses;
the manifold opportunities for fraud open to
mediums; and the fact that, with the single
exception of Home, every medium subjected to
scientific investigation has been caught practising
fraud at one time or another, it seems extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
rash to accept as genuine any of the phenomena of
physical mediumship.</p>

<p>Still, it would be incorrect to say that the
time devoted by psychical researchers to the
investigation of these phenomena has been time
wasted. They have performed a necessary police
duty for society, and their labors, as we shall see,
have been productive of psychological discoveries
of great practical importance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="f8">THE SUBCONSCIOUS</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> the Society for Psychical Research
was founded, in 1882, its purpose was not
only to obtain, if possible, scientifically acceptable
proof of the survival of human personality
after bodily death, but also to study the nature
of personality in its mundane aspects, with a
view to securing greater insight into the powers
and possibilities of man here on earth.</p>

<p>In this latter quest it has been eminently
successful, and thanks to its labors our knowledge
of ourselves has been increased a thousandfold.
As has been shown, phenomena hitherto regarded
as mysterious and &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo;&mdash;such as apparitions,
clairvoyance, crystal-gazing, etc.&mdash;have
been definitely explained on a purely naturalistic
basis; and, as was said at the close of the
last chapter, in addition to naturalizing the supernatural,
psychical researchers have made, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
have assisted in making, discoveries of great
practical utility, and having a profound bearing
on affairs of everyday life.</p>

<p>Among these, none is of more importance than
the discovery of the &ldquo;subconscious.&rdquo; This
term, which was almost unheard of a few years
ago, is nowadays used by psychologists in a variety
of ways, but it may be broadly defined as including
an extensive range of mental processes
and phenomena that occur beneath the surface
of our ordinary consciousness. Subconscious
mental action, in fact, has a constant, unceasing
part in our lives. It is in evidence in such commonplace
acts as walking, talking, writing, playing
the piano, handling a tool, a tennis racket,
or a baseball bat.</p>

<p>There was a time, in the experience of all of us,
when we could do none of these things, but had
to learn them by conscious effort. Little by
little, as we acquired more skill, the element of
consciousness became less and less, until at last
we could execute them in a seemingly automatic
manner, as in the fashion of the piano player described
by Miss Cobbe:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Two different lines of hieroglyphics have to be
read at once, and the right hand has to be guided
to attend to one of them, the left to the other.
All the fingers have the work assigned as quickly
as they can move. The mind, or something which
does duty as mind, interprets scores of A sharps,
and B flats, and C naturals into black ivory keys
and white ones, crotchets, and quavers, and demi-quavers,
rests, and all the mysteries of music.
The feet are not idle, but have something to do
with the pedals. And all this time the performer,
the <em>conscious</em> performer, is in a seventh heaven of
artistic rapture at the results of all this tremendous
business, or perchance lost in a flirtation with the
individual who turns the leaves of the music book,
and is justly persuaded she is giving him the whole
of her soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The subconscious is thus a sort of reservoir in
which are stored up, available for future use, the
things learned through education and experience;
and it also has a dynamic power that enables it to
supplement, economize, and enlarge the operations
of the upper consciousness. Ordinarily we fail to
appreciate what we owe to this hidden servitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for the reason that its workings are so smooth, so
unobtrusive, as to pass quite unnoticed. Yet
abundant evidence has been secured to demonstrate
not simply the fact of its existence, but the
more significant fact that it is never at rest, but
is perpetually laboring in our behalf.</p>

<p>Even when our consciousness is for the moment
completely in abeyance&mdash;as when we are
asleep&mdash;the subconscious continues operant.
Many of my readers have doubtless had the experience
of vainly endeavoring for hours, perhaps
for days, to solve some important problem, and
then awaking one morning with a luminously
clear idea of its correct solution. While they
slept, their subconsciousness had been at work
disentangling the threads of their conscious reasoning,
stripping away and discarding unessentials,
and finally presenting them with, so to speak, a
ready-made understanding of that which had
previously been so perplexing to them.</p>

<p>In all such cases the action of the subconscious
is more vividly evident when, as often happens,
the desired solution is gained during sleep itself,
in the form of a dream. An excellent example is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
found in an episode narrated by a business man,
who says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had been bothered since September with an
error in my cash account for that month, and,
despite many hours&rsquo; examination, it defied all
my efforts, and I almost gave it up as hopeless.
It had been the subject of my waking thoughts
for many nights, and had occupied a large portion
of my leisure hours. Matters remained thus unsettled
until the eleventh of December. On this
night I had not, to my knowledge, once thought
of the subject, but I had not been long in bed and
asleep, when my brain was as busy with the
books as though I had been at my desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cash book, banker&rsquo;s pass books, etc., etc.,
appeared before me; and, without any apparent
trouble, I almost immediately discovered the
cause of the mistakes, which had arisen out of a
complicated cross entry. I perfectly recollect
having taken a slip of paper in my dream, and
made such a memorandum as would enable me to
correct the error at some leisure time; and, having
done this, that the whole of the circumstances had
passed from my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When I awoke in the morning I had not the
slightest recollection of my dream, nor did it
once occur to me throughout the day, although
I had the very books before me on which I
had apparently been engaged in my sleep. When
I returned home in the afternoon, as I did early,
for the purpose of dressing, and proceeded to
shave, I took up a piece of paper from my dressing
table to wipe my razor, and you may imagine
my surprise at finding thereon the very memorandum
I fancied I had made during the previous
night. The effect on me was such that I returned
to our office and turned to the cash book, when I
found that I had really, while asleep, detected
the error which I could not detect in my waking
hours, and had actually jotted it down at the
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no recollection whatever as to where I
obtained the paper and pencil with which I made
the memorandum. It certainly must have been
written in the dark, and in my bedroom, as I
found both paper and pencil there the following
afternoon. The pencil was not one which I am in
the habit of carrying, and my impression is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
I must either have found it in the room, or gone
down-stairs for it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Illustrative of the same subconscious mechanism,
and doubly interesting because of the light
it throws on the true nature of many dreams frequently
regarded as supernatural, is a singular
experience that once befell Professor H.&nbsp;V. Hilprecht,
the well-known archæologist of the University
of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>At the time, Professor Hilprecht was trying to
decipher the inscriptions on two small fragments
of agate from the temple of Bel in ancient Babylonia,
and believed by him to be portions of the
finger rings of some wealthy Babylonian. He had
already published a preliminary report on the
collection of which they formed a part, but,
despite weeks of earnest effort, had utterly failed
to get at the meaning of the words inscribed on
them.</p>

<p>One Saturday night, after working on the fragments
until nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock without any
satisfactory result, he went to bed weary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
exhausted, and was soon in a deep sleep. He
then dreamed that he was transported to the
temple of Bel, where a venerable priest, whose
dress showed that he belonged to a pre-Christian
epoch, conducted him into the treasure chamber of
the temple. It was a small, low room, without
windows, and contained a large wooden chest,
around which were scattered pieces of agate and
other valuable stones. While Professor Hilprecht
stood looking at these, the priest said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two fragments which you have published
separately upon pages 22 and 26 belong together,
are not finger rings, and their history is as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Kurigalzu [who reigned in Babylonia
about 1300 <span class="f8">B.&nbsp;C.</span>], once sent to the temple of Bel,
among other articles of agate and lapis lazuli,
an inscribed votive cylinder of agate. Then we
priests suddenly received the command to make
for the statue of the god Ninib a pair of earrings
of agate. We were in great dismay, since there
was no agate at hand as raw material. In order
to execute the command, there was nothing for
us to do but cut the votive cylinder into three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
parts, making three rings, each of which contained
a portion of the original inscription.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first two rings served as earrings for the
statue of the god; the two fragments which have
given you so much trouble are portions of them.
If you will put the two together you will have
confirmation of my words. But the third ring
you have not yet found in the course of your
excavations, and you never will find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this the priest disappeared, and the dream
came to an end. In the morning, impressed with
its coherence and vividness, Professor Hilprecht
again attacked the troublesome fragments, put
them together as directed, and, by making the
proper guesses for the missing middle portion,
readily deciphered the full inscription: &ldquo;To the
god Ninib, son of Bel, his lord, has Kurigalzu,
pontifex of Bel, presented this.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Nor are the intellectual achievements of the
subconscious during sleep confined to the solution
of problems that have been vexing the upper
consciousness. It has a highly original, creative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
power of its own. Thus the composer Tartini
dreamed one night that he heard the devil playing
a wonderful sonata, and, remembering it on
awaking, was able to set it down on paper, and
thereby put to his credit one of the finest pieces
of music that bears his name. Coleridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kubla
Khan&rdquo; was another dream composition; and,
indeed, a long list of masterpieces in music, art,
and literature, originating through subconscious
mental action in sleep, might be drawn up.</p>

<p>A typical case was recently communicated to
me by a well-known Pacific Coast architect, Mr.
B.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;S. Cahill. He had been commissioned to
design a twenty-six-story office building, to be
erected in Portland, Oregon, and he determined,
if possible, to plan one that would be a real contribution
towards the solution of some of the most
difficult problems of modern commercial architecture.
For weeks Mr. Cahill labored hard to
devise a building that would unite a maximum
of beauty, solidity, and capacity with an abundance,
and as nearly as possible an equality, of
light and air for the many offices it was to contain.
The structure he ultimately conceived was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
novel, and differed conspicuously from the
ordinary four-sided office building, with its inner
offices lighted from a court.</p>

<p>His plan called for the construction of a building
shaped much like a St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross, or like
a square with a triangle cut out of each side. In
this way the need for an inner court was completely
obviated, and the only poorly ventilated
and dimly lighted portion of the building would
be its central &ldquo;core.&rdquo; Here the elevators and
stairs were to be located.</p>

<p>According to the architect&rsquo;s own statement,
this plan&mdash;which has been highly praised by so
eminent a critic as Mr. Montgomery Schuyler&mdash;was
born in his mind while he slept. One night
he saw in a dream a building shaped in this fashion,
and knew that his problem was solved. He tells
me that on awaking he made two rough sketches
of the plan in a pocket note-book&mdash;one showing
the general design, the other indicating the appearance
of the building when completed.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one has ever been more favored in
this same way than that remarkable man of
genius, the late Robert Louis Stevenson. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
plots for many of Stevenson&rsquo;s best stories&mdash;including
the marvelous &ldquo;Doctor Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde&rdquo;&mdash;came to him in dreams, as he himself
has related in a delightful autobiographical essay,
in which, with characteristic whimsicality, he
personifies his subconscious ideas as &ldquo;Brownies&rdquo;
and &ldquo;little people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This dreamer, like many other persons,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;has encountered some trifling vicissitudes
of fortune. When the bank begins to send letters,
and the butcher to linger at the back gates, he
sets to belaboring his brains after a story, for that
is his readiest money winner; and behold! at
once the little people begin to bestir themselves
in the same quest, and labor all night long, and
all night long set before him truncheons of tales
upon their lighted theater. No fear of his being
frightened now; the flying heart and the frozen
scalp are things bygone; applause, growing applause,
growing interest, growing exultation in his
own cleverness&mdash;for he takes all the credit&mdash;and
at last a jubilant leap to wakefulness, with the
cry: &lsquo;I have it, that&rsquo;ll do!&rsquo; upon his lips; with
such and similar emotions he sits at these nocturnal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
dreams, with such outbreaks, like Claudius
in the play, he scatters the performance in the
midst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Often enough the waking is a disappointment;
he has been too deep asleep, as I explain
the thing; drowsiness has gained his little people;
they have gone stumbling and maundering
through their parts; and the play, to the wakened
mind, is seen to be a tissue of absurdities. And
yet how often have these sleepless Brownies done
him honest service, and given him, as he sat idly
taking his pleasure in the boxes, better tales than
he could fashion for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more I think of it,&rdquo; Stevenson continues,
&ldquo;the more I am moved to press upon the world
my question: &lsquo;Who are the little people?&rsquo; They
are near connections of the dreamer&rsquo;s, beyond
doubt; they share in his financial worries, and
have an eye to the bank book; they share plainly
in his training; they have plainly learned, like
him, to build the scheme of a considerable story,
and to arrange emotion in progressive order;
only I think they have more talent; and one thing
is beyond doubt&mdash;they can tell him a story piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
by piece, like a serial, and keep him all the while
in ignorance of where they aim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That part of my work which is done while I
am sleeping is the Brownies&rsquo; part beyond contention;
but that which is done when I am up and
about is by no means necessarily mine, since all
goes to show the Brownies have a hand in it even
then.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>It is worth noting that facts like these have
recently led to a novel theory explanatory of
what is known as &ldquo;genius.&rdquo; Instead of adopting
the Lombrosian doctrine, and regarding the
man of genius as a kind of transcendental degenerate,
this latest theory affirms that he is what
he is by reason of enjoying a readier communication
than most men possess between the
conscious and subconscious portions of his mind.
Such a view has the further virtue of being completely
in accord with the familiar definition of
genius as an infinite capacity for hard work.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it must be evident
that the contents of the subconscious are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
up in large measure of knowledge gained at one
time or another by conscious endeavor and
thought. The man who thinks hard consciously,
is certain to have a richer fund of subconscious
information at his disposal than the one whose
conscious thinking is of the idle, futile, scatter-brained
sort. All successful men, whether a
Milton or a Rockefeller, a Shakespeare or a
Morgan, are men who have developed their subconscious
faculties by laborious application of
their conscious powers in the routine of daily
life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it has also to be observed
that knowledge is often obtained subconsciously
without passing through any preliminary stage
of conscious attention and awareness; and that,
by a reversal of the usual process, the conscious
frequently acquires from the subconscious information
of which it would otherwise be ignorant.</p>

<p>I have previously alluded to this interesting and
most important fact in my discussion of telepathy,
clairvoyance, crystal-gazing, and kindred problems
in psychical research. As we then saw, the
subconscious has a certain eerie faculty of imparting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
its information to the upper consciousness in
the way of hallucinations, indicative at times of
thought transference from mind to mind, or, more
commonly, originating merely from unnoticed
impressions of direct, personal experience.</p>

<p>It cannot be too firmly borne in mind that every
day of our lives we see and hear and feel more
than we realize; that these unobserved sights
and sounds and sensations may, nevertheless, be
subconsciously registered in our minds; and that
they may soon or late be projected above the
threshold of consciousness in a form astonishing,
puzzling, and perhaps annoying to us, as in the
case of a strange experience of a young New York
newspaper man.</p>

<p>It was his business to edit for publication in a
number of country newspapers the dispatches
sent in by a telegraphic news agency. He had
been thus engaged for perhaps a year when he
noticed, greatly to his dismay, that he was repeatedly
omitting items which he believed, on
reading them in the telegraphic copy, to be &ldquo;old
news,&rdquo; but which were printed with more or less
prominence in the next morning&rsquo;s issues of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
newspapers. This occurred so often that he began
to tremble for his position, and set himself earnestly
to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>Luckily he had some acquaintance with psychology,
and knew that his trouble must be due
to a faulty identification of subconscious with
conscious impressions. But why was it, he asked
himself, that on certain nights he would be quite
free from such errors of judgment, while on others
he might omit, or be strongly tempted to omit,
on the ground of supposed previous publication,
half a dozen items of real news value? The truth
dawned on him one evening as he was sitting down
to begin work.</p>

<p>On his desk lay a heap of envelopes containing
the dispatches that had come from the news agency
before his arrival at the newspaper office. These
should already have been opened by an office
boy, but that night he had been busy with something
else. Mechanically, the editor himself tore
open the envelopes, smoothed out their contents,
and, without reading them, made a neat pile of
the typewritten sheets, preparatory to going
through them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not been working an hour when he came
to a dispatch, which he tossed aside, with the
muttered comment, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an old story, sure.
I&rsquo;ve read it somewhere before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, remembering the mistakes he had been
making, he hesitated, picked it up, and read it
carefully. Every word in it seemed familiar.
But where could he have read it? In the evening
papers? He went through them one by one,
without result. Then it suddenly occurred to
him that possibly, in opening the dispatches, he
had, without being aware of it, glanced at this
particular item, and had obtained a subconscious
knowledge of it, which was now welling up confusedly
as a conscious memory.</p>

<p>To test this theory, he directed the office boy
to open the dispatches without fail for the next
few nights. On none of these did he suffer from
memory confusion.</p>

<p>Possibly, if he had analyzed the matter further,
he would have found that the news items which
had caught his eye while smoothing out the dispatch
sheets related to subjects of some special
interest to him. For just as one&rsquo;s conscious attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
is arrested by that which is particularly
interesting, so does the subconscious select for
presentation to the upper consciousness information
of temporary or habitual interest and significance.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, there is involved a harking
back to interests of an earlier period of life. A
simple but instructive illustration of this is found
in a little incident that occurred to Doctor Richard
Hodgson while on a visit to England. It may
best be reported in his own words:<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday morning (September 13, 1895),
just after breakfast, I was strolling alone along
one of the garden paths of Leckhampton House,
Cambridge, repeating aloud to myself the verses
of a poem. I became temporarily oblivious to
my garden surroundings, and regained my consciousness
of them suddenly, to find myself brought
to a stand, in a stooping position, gazing intently
at a five-leaved clover. On careful examination,
I found about a dozen specimens of five-leaved
clover, as well as several specimens of four-leaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
clover, all of which probably came from the same
root.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Several years ago I was interested in getting
extra-leaved clovers, but I have not for years
made any active search for them, though occasionally
my conscious attention, as I walked along,
has been given to appearances of four-leaved
clover, which proved, on examination, to be deceptive.
The peculiarity of yesterday&rsquo;s &lsquo;find&rsquo;
was that I discovered myself, with a sort of shock,
standing still and stooping down, and afterward
realized that a five-leaved clover was directly
under my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Compare with this an incident reported by an
English clergyman, the Reverend P.&nbsp;H. Newnham.
We find in it exactly the same element of selective
subconscious attention, accompanied, however,
by an auditory hallucination as a means of notifying
the upper consciousness of the fact subconsciously
observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was visiting friends at Tunbridge Wells,&rdquo;
says Mr. Newnham, &ldquo;and went out one evening,
entomologizing. As I crossed a stile into a field,
on my way to a neighboring wood, a voice said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
distinctly in my right ear: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;Chaonia&rdquo;
on that oak.&rsquo; This was a very scarce moth,
which I had never seen before, and which most
assuredly I had never consciously thought of
seeing. There were several oaks in the field, but
I instinctively walked up to one, straight to the
off side of it, and there was the moth indicated.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The psychological explanation of this is simple
enough, and is equally applicable to similar, if
more sensational, hallucinations widely heralded
as of supernatural character. It is manifestly
absurd to suppose that a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; announced to
the entomologizing clergyman the presence of the
rare and greatly sought-after moth which it was
his good fortune to capture. But it is not at all
absurd to suggest that quite likely, although he
had consciously forgotten all about it, he had at
some time seen Chaonia, or an entomological text-book
picture of Chaonia; that he had subconsciously
caught a glimpse of it, fluttering across
the field and settling on the oak, and that his subconscious
recognition of its identity had set in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
motion the proper mental mechanism to notify
his upper consciousness of a fact in which it would
naturally be much interested.</p>

<p>There may also be a subconscious intensification,
or &ldquo;hyperæsthesia,&rdquo; of other senses than that
of sight. In all probability hyperæsthesia of the
sense of hearing is sufficient to account for the
dramatic central incident in the following story,
told by a lady whose identity I am unable to
reveal:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was living one summer in a little mining
camp in the Rocky Mountains. Our house, a
frame building, was some little distance from any
other, at the top of a steep hill; the only disadvantage
of this being the additional difficulty of
getting water, which was an expensive commodity
in the camp, as the adjacent mines had
drained most of the wells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house contained six rooms, all opening
one out of another, my own room, with a dressing
closet beyond, where my child slept, being at one
end, and the front porch, which overlooked the
valley, at the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One evening, after my little girl was asleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
I lit a tiny night lamp, always left burning on a
bracket in her room; and, leaving all doors and
windows open, on account of the intense heat,
went to sit on the front porch. I may have sat
there half an hour, when my attention was caught
by a great blazing light in the direction of the
farthest houses. It appeared evident that one at
least had taken fire, and the difficulty of getting
water, and the hope that no children were in
danger, flashed through my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While watching the rapidly growing glare, I
heard a faint, crackling sound in my own house.
It would not have disturbed me at any other time,
as I only supposed that some smouldering piece
of cedar in the kitchen stove had blazed up.
But, with the present thought of fire in my mind,
I went into the kitchen to look, and, glancing
through the open doors as I passed, saw a volume
of flame and smoke pouring from the child&rsquo;s room
into mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God it was still possible to rush through
and save her; and I carried her out in a blanket
to prevent the scorch, for the room was only
burning at one end; the side where the bed stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
though fearfully hot and suffocating, was not yet
on fire, and, thanks to the timely warning, the
water left in the barrels proved just enough to
extinguish the flames before very much was destroyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all was quiet, I went back to the porch
to look at that other burning house, feeling so
thankful that my child was safe, and wondering
if others were, also. But all was dark, and when I
came to make inquiry next day, nothing was
known in the camp of any such fire. Had it not
been for my strange vision of it, which must have
lasted fully ten minutes, I feel sure that my little
girl would have been burned to death.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>There is a possibility, though only a possibility,
that telepathy between mother and child may
have had part in the production of this helpful
hallucination. But hyperæsthesia of the sense of
hearing seems to afford the likelier explanation,
as also in numerous well-authenticated instances,
in which railroad men, obeying an unaccountable
impulse or hallucinatory monition, have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
action averting disastrous wrecks. A single illustrative
example must suffice, a case called to the
attention of the Society for Psychical Research
by Mr. William H. Wyman, of Dunkirk, <abbr title="New York">N.&nbsp;Y.</abbr>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some years ago my brother was employed
on, and had charge as conductor and engineer of,
a work train on the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Railway, running between Buffalo and
Erie. I often went with him to the gravel bank,
where he had his headquarters, and returned on
his train with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On one occasion I was with him, and after
the train of cars was loaded, we went together
to the telegraph office to see if there were any
orders, and to find out if the trains were on time,
as we had to keep out of the way of all regular
trains. After looking over the train reports, and
finding them all on time, we started for Buffalo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we approached Westfield station, running
about twelve miles per hour, and when within
about one mile of a long curve in the line, my
brother all of a sudden shut off the steam, and,
quickly stepping over to the fireman&rsquo;s side of the
engine, he looked out of the cab window, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to the rear of his train. Not discovering anything
wrong, he put on steam, but almost immediately
again shut it off, and gave the signal for brakes,
and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After inspecting the engine and train, and
finding nothing wrong, he seemed very much
excited, and for a short time he acted as if he did
not know where he was or what to do. I asked
what was the matter. He replied that he did not
know; then, after looking at his watch and orders,
he said that he felt that there was some trouble
on the line of the road. I suggested that he had
better run his train to the station and find out.
He then ordered his flagman to go ahead around
the curve, which was just ahead of us, and he
would follow with the train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The flagman started and had barely time to
flag an extra express train, with the general superintendent
and others on board, coming full forty
miles an hour. The superintendent inquired what
he was doing there, and if he did not receive
orders to keep out of the way of the extra. My
brother told him that he had not received orders,
and did not know of any extra train coming; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
we had both examined the train reports before
leaving the station. The train was then backed
to the station, where it was found that no orders
had been given.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Incidents such as this are of not infrequent
occurrence. By the superstitious they are regarded
as weird and uncanny, and savoring of the
spiritistic. In reality they are only exceptional
exemplifications of a process which is ceaselessly
taking place in all of us. There is no one who
does not, every day, perform acts which he cannot
consciously account for, and which, if closely
inquired into, would be found similarly to take
their rise in unnoticed subconscious impressions.
For the matter of that, it is possible to train one-self
to subconscious attention to selected impressions,
even in sleep.</p>

<p>A familiar illustration is the mother who, undisturbed
by other sounds, awakens at the least
cry of her infant. The same phenomenon is observable
in the case of the conscientious medical
nurse, who, no matter how profound her sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
responds instantly to any movement by her
patient. And, in the course of conversation not
long ago, a physician said to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you know, my house is on a car line, and,
besides the cars, there is much automobile and
carriage traffic on my street for a large part of
the night. Nothing of this breaks my rest. I
sleep so soundly that a thunderstorm does not
arouse me. Yet let the telephone bell begin to
ring, and I am out of bed and have the receiver
at my ear before the bell has ceased ringing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have myself, like a good many other people,
found it possible to make the subconscious do the
work of an alarm clock. That is to say, if, on
going to bed, I mentally determine to wake at a
certain hour, I invariably do so, and this although
I am one of the deepest of sleepers. It matters
not what hour I select, nor how late I retire the
previous night, the mental sentinel whom I have
placed on guard punctually notifies me when
the appointed time arrives.</p>

<p>This goes to show, of course, that the subconscious
is, to a certain extent, at any rate, amenable
to conscious control and direction. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
such control is highly desirable is evinced not
merely by the facts reviewed above, but by others
which we must next take under consideration&mdash;facts
of altogether different import. For if,
as we have seen, the subconscious is in many ways
a docile and helpful auxiliary of the upper consciousness,
it also contains within itself dire possibilities
of unhappiness, suffering, disease, and
even death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="f8">DISSOCIATION AND DISEASE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> subconscious, I repeat, does not always
exercise a helpful influence; there are times
when it may impose upon us indescribable
misery.</p>

<p>It is able to do this by virtue of the intimate
relations existing between the mind and the body.
At this late day it is scarcely necessary for me
to undertake to demonstrate that the state of
one&rsquo;s mind has a great deal to do with the health
of one&rsquo;s body. What is not so generally known,
and what all of us ought to know, is the further
fact that many diseases are directly due to distressing
mental states, and in such cases usually
to subconscious mental states&mdash;that is to say,
to thoughts and emotions of which the sufferer
consciously has no knowledge. The same often
holds good even with regard to maladies the
symptoms of which are almost wholly if not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
physical, and the causes of which one
would naturally expect to find physical, likewise.</p>

<p>Indeed, ignorance of the tremendous rôle played
by the subconscious in the causation of disease,
has in the past been responsible for many medical
shortcomings. Nor is the situation as yet much
improved, although it is rapidly improving, thanks
chiefly to the labors of a little group of scientific
investigators known as psychopathologists, or
medical psychologists, who have made it their
special business to ascertain the different ways
in which the subconscious may affect health adversely,
and to devise methods for coping with
mentally caused diseases.</p>

<p>These men are not &ldquo;faith healers.&rdquo; They are
not making any war on medicine. They are, in
fact, themselves physicians, graduates of the
best medical schools, of excellent standing in their
profession, and seeking, above all things, to increase
the usefulness and precision of medical
science. Already, though their labors were begun
only a few years ago, they have effected numerous
cures of a seemingly miraculous character;
but always they have effected them by utilizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
natural laws which they have discovered by the
rigorous processes of scientific experiment.</p>

<p>Of fundamental importance among these laws
is one known as the law of dissociation. It might
almost be called the law of forgotten memories,
for to a large extent its workings depend on the
interesting circumstance, to which attention has
previously been drawn, that ideas which have
faded from the conscious memory persist in the
subconsciousness. As Pierre Janet, the distinguished
Frenchman and most eminent of living
psychopathologists, has tersely phrased it, &ldquo;Nothing
that goes into the human mind is ever really
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No matter how remote, past experiences, as I
have shown in earlier chapters, can be recovered
and recalled to mind by means of crystal-vision,
automatic writing, or other psychological methods
of &ldquo;tapping the subconscious.&rdquo; Obviously we
have here no absolute loss of memory, but merely
a splitting off, or &ldquo;dissociation,&rdquo; from the field
of waking consciousness.</p>

<p>Now, while the memories thus dissociated and
lying hidden in the subconscious usually exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
no appreciable effect other than in the molding
of character, the enlargement of our store of
knowledge, etc., there are conditions under which,
in the case of persons predisposed by circumstances
of heredity or environment, they may give
rise to all manner of mental and physical ills.</p>

<p>A person, for instance, experiences a sudden
fright. Time passes, the fright is completely forgotten,
or, at most, vaguely remembered. But
one day unmistakable, and sometimes exceedingly
peculiar, symptoms of disease appear. The
victim, it may be, suffers from a strange obsession
or &ldquo;fixed idea,&rdquo; or from a general &ldquo;nervous breakdown,&rdquo;
or from an actual paralysis of some bodily
organ, or from the development of abdominal
or other enlargements resembling true organic
growths.</p>

<p>Whatever the symptoms, the mechanism of
the puzzling malady is always the same. There
has been an abnormal dissociation. The ideas
connected with the original shock, although submerged
beneath the threshold of consciousness&mdash;in
a word, forgotten&mdash;remain vividly alive in the
subconscious, to act as perpetual irritants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
nervous system and in time to give rise to the
appearance of the symptoms of which the sufferer
complains. Often, indeed, the dissociation
is instantaneous, and the appearance of the disease
symptoms equally rapid.</p>

<p>In either case, the resultant malady is purely
psychical in its origin, and can be cured only by
psychical, not by physical means. What is needed
is to get at the dissociated mental states&mdash;the
forgotten, disease-creating memories&mdash;and reassociate
them with the upper consciousness, or
root them out completely by means of &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo;
skillfully applied.</p>

<p>This is no fanciful theory. It is the solidest
kind of fact, repeatedly tested and verified. Time
and again, patients pronounced incurable by competent
physicians have been taken in hand by
the psychopathologists and, once their disease
has been definitely traced to some dissociation,
have been restored to perfect health.</p>

<p>For the matter of that, of course, the same
thing has been done to some extent by Christian
Science healers and other irregular practitioners
of &ldquo;mental medicine.&rdquo; But the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
all of these and the psychopathologists is
just this&mdash;that the former apply the healing
power of suggestion to all sorts of diseases, and
without any adequate understanding of its laws
and limitations, whereas the psychopathologists
recognize that it is only one of several valuable
medical methods, and that it is legitimately applicable
only to certain maladies.</p>

<p>Experience has taught them, too, that even
within its proper sphere of usefulness it often is
of therapeutic value only after a searching scientific
examination of the patient&rsquo;s subconsciousness
has brought to light the particular dissociated
states which have to be corrected before a cure
can be wrought.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the range of maladies susceptible
of cure by psychopathological processes is marvelously
wide, and it is no exaggeration to say
that the discovery of the influence exercised
by the subconscious in the causation of disease
is one of the most vitally significant ever made
in the history of medicine.</p>

<p>The truth of this may readily be shown by
citing a few cases illustrating some of the manifold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
ways in which dissociation works havoc in the
human organism, and the extreme ingenuity displayed
by the skilled psychopathologist in overcoming
its ravages.</p>

<p>There was brought one day to the Parisian
hospital of the Salpêtrière, the world&rsquo;s greatest
center of psychopathological investigation, a
woman of forty, designated in the medical record
of her case by the name of Justine. She was
accompanied by her husband, who explained that
he wished Doctor Janet to examine her because
he feared that she had become insane. And, in
fact, she presented the aspect of a veritable
maniac. Her jet-black hair was flowing loosely
over her shoulders, her eyes were fixed and glaring,
her hands trembling, the muscles of her neck
twitching, and she constantly made the most
horrible grimaces. When Doctor Janet gently
sought to question her, she buried her face in her
hands, and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is terrible to live thus! I am afraid, I
am so afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of what, pray, are you afraid?&rdquo; the
physician asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid of cholera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all you are afraid of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely it is quite enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Janet turned for an explanation to her
husband, who shook his head despairingly, as
he replied in an undertone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the way she has been for years, doctor,
only lately she has grown much worse. She will
scarcely eat anything, for fear of catching cholera.
It is difficult to persuade her to stir from the
house. She seems to think the air is full of cholera
germs. She sees cholera in everything. Tell me,
doctor, is my poor Justine mad? Must we be
separated, she and I? Is it that she will have to
spend the rest of her life in an asylum?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave her here a few days,&rdquo; said Doctor
Janet, &ldquo;and I can tell you better then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psychopathologists have invented some delicate
tests for discriminating infallibly between
true organic insanity, which in the present state
of medical knowledge is quite incurable, and functional
mental troubles due to dissociation. Applying
these, Doctor Janet soon reached the conclusion
that Justine was not really insane, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that her &ldquo;phobia,&rdquo; or irrational fear, was due to
some forgotten shock connected with the disease
cholera.</p>

<p>But, closely though he questioned her, she
could recall nothing of the sort. He then decided
to try the effect of hypnotizing her, for, as all
psychopathologists are aware, hypnotism, when
it is possible to use it, is an unrivaled agency for
recovering lost memories. Put into the hypnotic
state, patients easily remember incidents in their
past of which they have no conscious recollection
when in the normal, waking state. It was thus
with Justine, who proved to be most hypnotizable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; Doctor Janet told her, after she
had passed into deep hypnosis, &ldquo;to try to remember
whether at any time in your life you saw
a person suffering from cholera, or one who had
died from cholera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly I did,&rdquo; she promptly replied,
shuddering violently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was a little girl&mdash;fifteen years
old.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother was very poor. She had to take
all sorts of work. Sometimes she nursed sick
people, and when they died she got them ready
for burial. Once two people in our neighborhood
died from cholera, and I helped her with the
corpses. They made a frightful sight&mdash;one of
them, at all events. It was the body of a man,
naked, and all blue and green. Oh, frightful,
frightful! What if I should catch the cholera?
I shall catch it, I know I shall! Nothing can save
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice rose in a shriek of terror, and Doctor
Janet hastened to de-hypnotize her.</p>

<p>The situation was now perfectly clear to him.
Evidently the sight of the corpse, &ldquo;naked, and
all blue and green,&rdquo; had so profoundly affected
the impressionable girl as to cause a severe dissociation
whereby all memory of the shocking
episode had been blotted out of her consciousness,
only to be subconsciously remembered in most
minute detail.</p>

<p>To bring about a cure, to free her from the obsessing
dread of cholera, it was necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
remove the gruesome subconscious memory image,
and Doctor Janet essayed to do this through suggestions
given to her when she was again hypnotized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will no longer think of this,&rdquo; he kept
assuring her. &ldquo;You will forget it, absolutely,
permanently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day after day, for weeks, he hypnotized her,
and reiterated similar commands. But she continued
to be afflicted with her irrational fear,
and it finally became certain that her subconscious
recollection of the phobia-causing scene
of twenty-five years before was too deeply
rooted to be destroyed by direct attack. Instead,
however, of abandoning the task as hopeless,
Doctor Janet, with a shrewdness born of
long experience, made a clever change in tactics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You insist,&rdquo; he said to the hypnotized Justine,
&ldquo;that you cannot help seeing in your
mind&rsquo;s eye the corpse of the man who died.
Very well, I have no objection to that. But
hereafter you must see it decently clothed. So
when it next appears to you, you will see it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
wearing a bright blue-and-green uniform, the
uniform of a foreign military officer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happily, this suggestion &ldquo;took,&rdquo; and Doctor
Janet followed up his advantage by suggesting
that the subconscious memory image which she
regarded as that of a corpse was, in reality,
the image of a living man. This suggestion
likewise being successful, he set about getting
rid of the idea &ldquo;cholera,&rdquo; and its dire implications.
Hypnotizing the patient as usual, he
demanded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this &lsquo;cholera&rsquo; that troubles you
so much? Do you not understand that it is
only the name of the fine gentleman in blue and
green, whom you see marching up and down?
He is a Chinese general, and his name is Cho Le
Ra. Bear that well in mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite evidently there was nothing to inspire
dread in the image of a picturesque Chinese
officer, General Cho Le Ra. Little by little,
as this artificial conception obtained firmer lodgment
in Justine&rsquo;s subconsciousness, the baneful
idea which it was intended to supplant faded
away, and with its fading the abnormal fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
diminished, until at length it entirely disappeared,
greatly to her joy and the warm gratitude
of her devoted husband.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Other psychopathologists, following Doctor
Janet&rsquo;s lead, have similarly used this method of
substituting one subconscious idea for another.
Doctor John E. Donley, a well-known neurologist
of Providence, Rhode Island, and one of
the few psychopathologists whom the United
States has yet produced, was once consulted by a
young man of thirty-two, who said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Donley, I hear you have been very
successful in handling people troubled with foolish
notions. I&rsquo;m bothered with as foolish a
notion as any one could possibly imagine. I
simply can&rsquo;t bear to ride in a street-car with an
odd number. Even-numbered cars give me no
trouble at all, but if an odd-numbered car comes
along, I&rsquo;ve got to let it pass, no matter how great
my hurry. My friends laugh at me, but I tell
you it&rsquo;s no laughing matter. The thing has got
on my nerves so that it is unbearable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been suffering in this
way?&rdquo; asked Doctor Donley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For years. Just when it began I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it only odd-numbered cars that affect
you? How about odd-numbered houses, for
instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered the young man, &ldquo;it
isn&rsquo;t odd numbers in general. That doesn&rsquo;t
bother me a bit. It&rsquo;s just when they&rsquo;re painted
on street-cars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Doctor Donley. &ldquo;Ever been in
a street-car accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever seen one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure as to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any objection to my hypnotizing
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, if it is likely to do me any
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another ten minutes the problem was
solved. Doctor Donley from the outset had felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
confident that the young man&rsquo;s phobia must be
connected in some way with a street-car accident,
and so it proved. Fourteen years earlier, when
walking along the street, he had seen a car strike
and seriously injure a child who unexpectedly
came from behind a wagon. He had noticed
at the time that the car bore the number two
hundred and thirteen, and he remembered thinking
to himself: &ldquo;There is always bad luck in
thirteen.&rdquo; The sight of the accident gave him
a marked emotional shock, which, he said, upset
him for several days.</p>

<p>All of this had long since passed from his
waking memory, but was distinctly recalled
during hypnosis. It was clear to Doctor Donley
that the case was one of dissociation, and that
the exciting cause of the young man&rsquo;s unreasonable
dread of odd-numbered cars was based on a
painfully vivid subconscious memory image of
the consciously forgotten tragedy. Also, it was
evident that before the dread could be overcome
the distressing memory image would have to be
eradicated.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, Doctor Donley resorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to the method of substitution, suggesting to the
patient, while still under hypnotic influence, that
he was quite mistaken in supposing that the
street-car had seriously injured the little girl;
that, on the contrary, it had scarcely touched her.</p>

<p>The result, after only eight days&rsquo; treatment,
was effectually to replace the painful memory
image with one free from distressing associations.
As by magic, the young man shook off his absurd
phobia. No longer, when he had to take a car,
did he stand on street corners, sometimes for an
hour at a time, waiting anxiously for a car with
an even number to appear.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Bizarre as these cases must seem, they are
actually typical of a widespread malady that
causes an amount of suffering only appreciable
by the sufferers themselves. In every land there
are thousands of men and women afflicted with
obsessions equally strange and equally distressing,
yet amenable to treatment by the methods
of psychopathology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Often, in order to effect a cure, it is not necessary
to make use of the roundabout device just
described. Direct suggestion&mdash;a strongly negative
command imposed in the hypnotic state&mdash;is
frequently sufficient.</p>

<p>Often, besides, it is not necessary to use hypnotism
at all, a cure resulting if only the psychopathologist
can dig down to the root of the
trouble, and, by recalling to conscious recollection
the lost memory image, reassociate it with
the rest of the contents of the upper consciousness.</p>

<p>Particularly interesting in this connection, as
being illustrative also of an ingenious method of
&ldquo;mind tunnelling&rdquo; nowadays frequently employed
to get at forgotten memories, is a case
reported by Doctor A.&nbsp;A. Brill, a New York
psychopathologist. His patient was a young
woman who applied to be treated for extreme
nervousness. She had been perfectly well until
three months before, when, she said, she had
begun to suffer from a complication of disorders,
including insomnia, loss of appetite, constant
headache, irritability, and stomach trouble. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
physical cause for her condition could be detected,
and Doctor Brill suspected that it was
due to some secret anxiety, but the patient
earnestly assured him that she &ldquo;had nothing
on her mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To get at the facts which he suspected she
was consciously or unconsciously concealing from
him, Doctor Brill decided to make use of what
is known as the &ldquo;association-reaction method
of mental diagnosis,&rdquo; a cumbersome and formidable
term for a really simple process.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that if a man is suddenly
asked a question bearing on matters which personally
concern him and which he is anxious to
keep entirely to himself, he is apt to &ldquo;react&rdquo;
to the question in a way that will betray the
true state of affairs. He may blush or stammer
before replying, may reply evasively, may find
it impossible to reply at all. If he is a man of
uncommon self-control, and not to be taken off
his guard, the reply may come smoothly enough,
and to all appearance without hesitation. Nevertheless,
experiment has shown that, even in such
cases, there is an appreciable difference in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
time, if not in the character, of the replies he
makes to emotion-arousing questions, as compared
with the time it takes him to reply to
questions that have no special significance to
him. The same holds good in the case of questions
evoking within him memories&mdash;albeit perhaps
wholly subconscious memories&mdash;of happenings
that may be no longer, but once were, of
keen emotional import to him.</p>

<p>Out of the discovery of this fact the association-reaction
method has been evolved. The specialist
using it reads slowly to his patient a list of one
hundred words or more, and requests him, as
he hears each, to respond with the first word that
comes into his mind. Seemingly the list of
stimulus words is chosen at random; actually it
is so constructed that some of the words are likely
to stir into activity the subconscious memories
of which the physician is in search. If they do
this the fact will be disclosed in the time of his
reaction-words&mdash;the words he utters in reply&mdash;as
measured by a chronoscope or stop-watch;
or in their character, as noted down by the
specialist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, it is necessary for the physician to
select words having, or likely to have, emotional
significance to the particular patient; and as a
guide in the selection, strange though it may
seem, nothing is more useful than the patient&rsquo;s
dreams. For it has been definitely established
that dreams are far from being the haphazard
products of imagination they are generally supposed
to be; that on the contrary, no matter
how trivial or nonsensical they seem, they always
have an emotional foundation corresponding with
some present or past reality; and that usually
they mask matters of distinct significance to the
dreamer.</p>

<p>As a preliminary, then, in the treatment of
his nervous patient, Doctor Brill asked her to
write out her dreams and bring them to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I never dream, except
when I am troubled by indigestion, and then
my dreams are so absurd that they are not worth
telling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;Whenever
you do happen to have a dream, report it to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Laughingly she promised to comply, and one
day brought him the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed that I was in a lonely country place
and was anxious to reach my home, but could
not get there. Every time I made a move there
was a wall in the way&mdash;it looked like a street
full of walls. My legs were as heavy as lead;
I could only walk very slowly as if I were very
weak or very old. Then there was a flock of
chickens, but that seemed to be in a crowded city
street, and they&mdash;the chickens&mdash;ran after me,
and the biggest of all said something like: &lsquo;Come
with me into the dark.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is my dream, and
if you can make head or tail of it, it is more than
I can. It is so ridiculous that I am ashamed to
tell it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Doctor Brill was already at work drawing
up a test list, with the more striking words of
the dream sprinkled through it. Twice he read
the list to her, noting not only the time of her
responses, but also their character.</p>

<p>He was immediately impressed by the fact
that certain of the dream words&mdash;such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
&ldquo;chicken,&rdquo; &ldquo;street,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dark&rdquo; had caused
a noticeable time variation; and that she had
also given in her responses words that would not
ordinarily be associated with the test words.
Especially peculiar was the association of &ldquo;mystery&rdquo;
and &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;dark.&rdquo;
The suspicion formed in his mind that a disappointment
in love might be at the bottom of all
her disease symptoms. But he did not at once
give voice to this idea; instead, he sought to
obtain corroboration from her own lips without
her appreciating his purpose, by means of another
method of &ldquo;mind tunnelling&rdquo; known as
the method of free association.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;to concentrate
your attention on the word &lsquo;chicken,&rsquo; and state
the thoughts that come to you in connection
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her reply, given after a few moments of silent
meditation, was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember now that I could see only the
biggest chicken; all the others seemed blurred;
it was unusually big and had a very long neck
and it spoke to me. The street in which I saw it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
recalls where I used to go to school&mdash;the block
was always crowded with school children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, and began to blush and laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Doctor Brill encouragingly.
&ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it recalls the happy school days when
I was young and had no worries. I even had
a beau, a boy who attended the same school.
We used to meet after school hours and walk
home together. He was lanky and thin, and the
girls used to tease me about him. Whenever
they saw him coming, they said: &lsquo;Belle, here
comes your chicken.&rsquo; That was his nickname
among the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stopping suddenly, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Brill, it couldn&rsquo;t be possible that the
chicken with the long neck, that I saw in my
dream, was my old beau!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It begins to look very much like it,&rdquo; he
smiled. &ldquo;Have you seen him lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And before then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little by little the whole story came out.
They had kept up their acquaintance after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
school days were long gone. Three times he had
asked her to marry him, but each time she had
refused, because although she &ldquo;liked&rdquo; him she
was not at all sure that she &ldquo;loved&rdquo; him. At
last she had decided that the next time he proposed
she would accept. But he had not proposed
again. And shortly before she became ill
she had heard that he was paying attentions to
another young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it,&rdquo; interposed Doctor Brill, &ldquo;that he
is not so well off as he might be, and that this had
something to do with your refusing to marry
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your dream I note that you state: &lsquo;Every
time I made a move there was a wall in the way;
it looked like a street full of walls.&rsquo; A street
full of walls might easily signify Wall Street&mdash;hence
money. That has been the real obstacle,
has it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She confessed that he was right.</p>

<p>He then explained that the one great cause
of her ills was her insistent, if subconscious,
brooding over the disappointment she had experienced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and that her cure depended upon her
ability to overcome this mental attitude. Realizing
for the first time, as a result of the dream
analysis, that she was really in love with the man
she had three times declined to wed, she soon
solved the problem. Only a hint was needed
to transform him into a suitor once more, and
within a very few months they were happily
married.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes direct questioning is sufficient to
enable the physician to get at the underlying
mental cause of trouble. Take, for example, another
case successfully treated by Doctor Donley.</p>

<p>The patient was a woman of thirty-five who
was troubled by a constant and involuntary
hacking, which sounded as though she were
trying to clear her throat. Drugs, local applications,
and electricity had been tried at intervals
during more than four years, but to no purpose.
On inquiry, it was found that the trouble had
set in about five years before, when the patient,
who was a mill hand, had suffered from a sore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
throat. The physician whom she then consulted
told her that she had a bad case of tonsilitis,
and that her tonsils would have to be burned
out.</p>

<p>Greatly frightened, she had hurried home, refusing
to submit to the operation. In a few days
the tonsilar symptoms disappeared, and she returned
to work. But she was attacked a second
time three weeks later, and visited another doctor,
to be informed that her tonsils were so badly
diseased that it would be well to have them removed
by cutting.</p>

<p>Again she refused to submit to an operation,
but the fear of cutting, added to her previous
fear, now revived, of burning out her tonsils,
threw her into a highly nervous state. She then
began to experience an unpleasant stinging,
tickling feeling in her throat, which she tried to
remove by hacking. As the tickling continued,
the hacking became more and more frequent,
and by the time she came under Doctor Donley&rsquo;s
observation had taken on the character of a
&ldquo;tic,&rdquo; or uncontrollable muscular movement.</p>

<p>These facts in the early history of the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the patient herself remembered only vaguely.
But she confessed that she was still tormented
by a haunting fear of a possible future burning
or cutting of her tonsils. Finding her exceedingly
suggestible, Doctor Donley made no attempt
to hypnotize her. He merely requested
her to close her eyes, remain perfectly passive,
and listen attentively to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was then told, with much emphasis,&rdquo; he
says, in describing the treatment, &ldquo;that her
tonsils were perfectly healthy, that no cutting
or burning ever was or ever would be required;
that the tickling sensation in her throat arose
from the constant fixation of attention upon this
part; that she would feel no more desire to hack
because her supposed reason for hacking had
ceased to exist, and finally, that when she should
open her eyes she would feel better than she had
in a good many years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much emphasis was placed upon this feeling
of health, because it was desired to leave her
on the crest of a pleasurable emotion, which of
itself has a very great suggestive value. What
had been predicted in her regard actually occurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
When she sat up, her tic had disappeared,
and she expressed herself as feeling quite grateful
and happy. The treatment lasted an hour, and
except for two slight recurrences easily removed
by waking suggestion, this patient has had no
further difficulty.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, such an easy solution of problems
like this is comparatively rare, particularly
when, as in this instance, a physical trouble is
superadded to the mental. Often&mdash;a fact which
cannot be emphasized too strongly&mdash;it happens
that, in dissociational cases, physical symptoms
so far predominate as to lead to totally wrong
diagnosis, even by experienced physicians. This
results, as was hinted above, from the power
inherent in subconscious &ldquo;fixed ideas&rdquo; of producing
an endless variety of disturbances simulating
true organic diseases, it may be diseases
remediable only through surgical operations.</p>

<p>As a consequence, innumerable operations have
been performed on patients who should have been
given, not surgical but psychopathological treatment.
I have in mind as I write a case of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
kind that was called to my attention by a friend
who participated in the lamentable affair.</p>

<p>A middle-aged woman entered one of the
Boston hospitals and complained of severe abdominal
pains, which she attributed to cancer
of the stomach or intestines. She was obviously
greatly frightened, and suffering intense agony.
A diagnosis of appendicitis was made, and an
immediate operation deemed imperative.</p>

<p>But, to the surprise of the surgeons, the appendix
was found to be in a normal condition.
At once they directed their attention to the
other abdominal organs, examining them one
by one. None showed any sign of disease. Finally,
with a rueful smile, one of the surgeons
straightened up, and, touching a finger to his
head, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble with this poor woman, gentlemen,
is here, not in the region that we have been
exploring. But we should not undeceive her.
We will remove the appendix, on general principles,
and that will probably be all that is needed
to cure the trouble in her head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, it was excellent advice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
But how much better it would have been
for the unfortunate woman, whose life was thus
endangered by the surgeon&rsquo;s knife, if it had been
recognized from the beginning that her malady
was only a &ldquo;hysterical simulation&rdquo; of the symptoms
of appendicitis. Some day, when physicians
generally make themselves acquainted with the
diagnostic methods of psychopathology, blunders
like this will be, as they ought to be, most exceptional.</p>

<p>In point both of diagnosis and treatment,
again, psychopathological knowledge is indispensable
to the correct handling of such cases
as the following, reported by Doctor Janet.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
It is, I am ready to concede, an unusual case,
but it is unusual only because it presents a complex
of symptoms commonly found singly or in
simpler combination.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to estimate with any
accuracy the number of persons who, afflicted
only in scant degree like this poor Marcelle,
have been obliged to drag out an existence worse
than death, either in the care of their friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
or immured in an institution, simply because
their medical attendants, ignorant of the workings
of the law of dissociation, have been unable
to fathom the true nature of their ills and adopt
adequate curative measures.</p>

<p>Marcelle, as Doctor Janet calls her, was only
nineteen years old when she began to astonish
her relatives by developing what they were at
first disposed to regard as nothing but an eccentric
form of laziness. She would constantly ask
them to give her objects&mdash;a book, her crochet
work, a plate&mdash;which she could easily have got
for herself by stretching out her hand and picking
them up. To all expostulations, she would
calmly reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I can&rsquo;t use my hands as I
once did, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t use your hands! What nonsense!
You can use them to eat with, well enough, and
you are crocheting most of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference? Tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Marcelle could not, or would not, tell them,
and from joking with her the family soon passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to a state of wrath, endeavoring in every way to
overcome her &ldquo;stupid obstinacy.&rdquo; Their anger
in turn gave way to fear, when, one night, noticing
a glimmer of light in her room, they entered, and
found her standing, fully dressed, before the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is this!&rdquo; they exclaimed, in amazement.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get your clothes off
and go to bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t undress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, all arguments proving vain, it was necessary
for her sister to disrobe her as though she
were a tiny child. Next day a consultation was
held, and it was decided to take her to the Salpêtrière.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem insane,&rdquo; her mother explained,
when applying to have her admitted.
&ldquo;She talks sensibly about most things. Can it
be that she is really suffering from some kind
of paralysis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and we will
do our best to discover what it is and cure it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This turned out to be no easy matter. Doctor
Janet, into whose care she came, had no difficulty
in determining that the specific malady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
which afflicted her was an extreme form of
&ldquo;aboulia,&rdquo; a disease involving temporary paralysis
of the will, and thereby preventing all muscular
movement. But it was one thing to make a
diagnosis, and another to effect a cure.</p>

<p>Presently, too, indications of mental disturbance
developed. Doctor Janet had discovered
that by distracting her attention he could induce
her to rise, extend her hands, and perform other
acts that were impossible to her when she concentrated
her attention on them. He utilized
this as an argument to try and persuade her
that she could always control her limbs if she
only made sufficient effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are quite wrong,&rdquo; she calmly informed
him. &ldquo;I have not left my chair, I have
not put out my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly you have. You know very
well I did not give you that piece of crochet
work. How, then, does it come into your hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not pick it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody else&mdash;somebody acting in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later arose another complication. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
refused to eat, and it became necessary to administer
food to her forcibly. She kept saying
to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must die, you must die as soon as possible.
You must not eat, you have no need of eating.
You must not speak, you have no voice,
you are paralyzed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say this?&rdquo; Doctor Janet one
day asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do I say what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He repeated her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have said nothing of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no&mdash;it was not I; it was somebody
else acting in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again that phrase&mdash;&ldquo;somebody else acting
in me.&rdquo; Greatly impressed, Doctor Janet threw
her into deep hypnosis. Now, an unexpected
and most pathetic passage of personal history
came to light. A year before, Marcelle had had
a secret love affair, her lover had deserted her,
she had determined to commit suicide. Failing
to do this, she had, none the less&mdash;overwhelmed
by the shock of the desertion, and giving herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
wholly to grief and chagrin, which she felt obliged
to allow no one to perceive&mdash;gradually passed
into a dissociated, dreamlike state, in which she
subconsciously pictured herself to herself either
as no longer existing or as about to perish.</p>

<p>Hence her &ldquo;aboulia,&rdquo; hence the &ldquo;somebody
else acting in me,&rdquo; hence the refusal to take food.
To Doctor Janet the situation was now almost
as clear as the light of day&mdash;so, likewise, was the
course which he would need to follow to restore
the sufferer to her &ldquo;real self,&rdquo; and rid her of all
disease symptoms.</p>

<p>The dissociation, to put it briefly, had in this
case been so complete as to cause an actual disruption
of the sense of personality. Nor is this
malady of &ldquo;loss of personality&rdquo; as rare as one
might be tempted to think. I could mention
many cases not unlike that of Marcelle&rsquo;s, and
some far surpassing it in astounding developments.
There is, for example, the singular case
of BCA. But this is so remarkable, so weirdly
fascinating, and so instructive that it deserves
to be treated, as I shall treat it in the next chapter,
entirely by itself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="f8">THE SINGULAR CASE OF BCA</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">During</span> his long career as a specialist in the
treatment of nervous and mental diseases,
Doctor Morton Prince, the celebrated Boston
psychopathologist, has been called upon to deal
with many puzzling human riddles, and to solve
mysteries which, in their way, have been quite
as complicated and baffling as any that ever
taxed the ingenuity of that most ingenious of
story-book detectives, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
In fact, some of the problems laid before the
New England specialist surpass even the most
astonishing of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes,
thus proving once more that truth is stranger
than fiction. This particularly applies to the
BCA affair.</p>

<p>In the beginning, however, there was nothing
in the BCA affair to suggest to Doctor Prince
that it had features which would test to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
utmost his psychopathological skill. It opened
in a prosaic, matter-of-fact way, with the arrival
at his office of a young woman who wished
to be treated for what she described as a &ldquo;nervous
breakdown.&rdquo; The story she told was a sad
one, but he had heard many quite like it before,
and it did not impress him as involving anything
out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My trouble,&rdquo; she said, in describing the
evolution of her malady, &ldquo;began when my
husband was attacked with an incurable disease.
For four years my life was altogether given up
to caring for him, striving to make him as comfortable
as possible, and endeavoring to conceal
from him my grief and anxiety. You can imagine
the strain put upon me all that time. Finally
he died, under circumstances that caused me a
great shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Within less than a week after his death, I
lost twenty pounds in weight. For nearly three
months I ate scarcely anything, and did not
average more than three or four hours&rsquo; sleep out
of the twenty-four. I was depressed, overwhelmed;
felt that I had lost all that made life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
worth living; and, in short, wished to die. I
became highly nervous, tired easily, and suffered
almost constantly from headaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This went on for many months. Then there
came a period of temporary recovery. Strangely
enough, it followed an occurrence that brought
to me suddenly a realization that my position
in life was entirely changed, that I was quite
alone, desolate, and helpless. For a few minutes
these ideas flashed through my mind, and then
all seemed changed. I no longer minded what, a
moment before, had caused me so much distress;
and, what is more, I immediately began to improve
in health, until I was able to mingle with
my friends, take long walks, go driving, and
really enjoy life as I had formerly done. Alas,
there soon was a relapse, and now I am feeling
worse than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Listening to her recital, and examining carefully
her mental and physical condition, Doctor
Prince felt justified in assuring her that there
was nothing seriously the matter, and that he
would ere long have her on the highway to health.
In fact, he regarded her case as one presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
&ldquo;the ordinary picture of so-called neurasthenia,
characterized by persistent fatigue and the usual
somatic symptoms, and by moral doubts and
scruples&rdquo;; and planned a course of treatment
which he expected would speedily result in a
cure. It was, to describe it briefly, treatment by
hypnotic suggestion&mdash;a method often employed
by psychopathologists in handling cases of neurasthenia,
for they have discovered that it is
perfectly feasible to &ldquo;suggest away&rdquo; the fatigue,
insomnia, and other symptoms connected with
this widespread and distressing malady.</p>

<p>The use of hypnotism in the present instance,
though, was attended by consequences vastly
different from any Doctor Prince had anticipated,
since it revealed to him that his patient was, in
reality, suffering from something infinitely more
serious than ordinary neurasthenia, and infinitely
more difficult to overcome. Put into
the hypnotic state, her ills, to Doctor Prince&rsquo;s
amazement, disappeared as though by a miracle.
Her whole expression was altered. She looked,
and declared that she felt, entirely well. It was
hard to believe that this radiant, vigorous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
brightly smiling woman was the one who had
entered his office so short a time before, a typical
nervous wreck, her features haggard and careworn,
her eyes dull and heavy, her hands trembling.
And, most astonishing of all, the hypnotized
patient herself insisted that, in a very literal
sense, she was not the same person.</p>

<p>The tone, the language, the manner&mdash;all
were changed. Struck with sudden apprehension,
Doctor Prince quickly brought her out of hypnosis.
Immediately there was another transformation,
and she was neurasthenic once more, without
the slightest remnant of the strength, independence,
and self-assertiveness she had just
been displaying. Nor, although she was sharply
questioned, could she remember anything she
had said while hypnotized; still, this proved
nothing, for it is seldom that what goes on during
hypnosis is recalled in the waking state.</p>

<p>But, comparing her latest declarations with
her prior account of the course her malady had
run, Doctor Prince could not help asking himself
whether she might not actually be a victim of
what is technically designated &ldquo;total dissociation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of personality,&rdquo; whether the second emotional
shock of which she had spoken, acting
on a system already disorganized by the severe
and prolonged strain imposed upon her by her
husband&rsquo;s illness, might not have resulted in a
psychical upheaval so catastrophic as to involve
the disintegration of her ego, or &ldquo;self,&rdquo; and the
creation of a secondary self markedly differing
from her original personality.</p>

<p>In such an event, the period of temporary recovery
would, indeed, represent a period when
the secondary self had obtained at least partial
control of the patient&rsquo;s organism; and it was
quite conceivable that there might come a time
when, momentarily, at any rate, the secondary
self would become wholly dominant. In that
case, the young woman&rsquo;s plight would be appalling,
for she would be in ignorance of all she said
and did while in the secondary state. This was
precisely what occurred.</p>

<p>Only a few days after she had first visited him,
she came into Doctor Prince&rsquo;s office in a greatly
excited condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the strangest, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
inexplicable thing has happened to me! This
morning, after breakfast, I went up-stairs, intending
to lie down for a time, as I felt so utterly
exhausted. I think I fell asleep, but am not sure.
I do know, though, that two hours afterward I
found myself standing in the post-office, about
to mail to you a letter which I am certain I did
not write, but which is plainly in my handwriting.
It is such a queer letter, too, for it
speaks of matters of which I know nothing, and
even refers to me as though I were somebody else,
and somebody else were I. What does this
mean? What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, in a day or so, she had an even stranger
story to relate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I went for
a walk, not because I wanted to, but because
you had told me that I ought to take some exercise.
I returned home about four o&rsquo;clock, and went
straight to my room. I remember nothing of
what then happened until, in the evening, I
suddenly became aware that I was at a gay
dinner party, drinking wine&mdash;which is contrary
to my principles&mdash;and, what was far worse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
smoking a cigarette. Never in my life had I
done such a thing, and my humiliation at the
discovery was deep and keen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, on my honor, that I have not
the least recollection of accepting an invitation
to dine out, of dressing for dinner, or of leaving
the house to attend the party. Everything is a
blank to me from the moment I went to my
room, in the afternoon, until I came to my senses,
several hours afterward, to find a lively group
about me, a wineglass at my plate, and a half-smoked
cigarette in my fingers. Tell me, Doctor
Prince, am I going insane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physician hastened to reassure her, but
nevertheless he felt seriously alarmed. It was
evident that she was in a thoroughly dissociated
condition, and that she had become, so to speak,
a battleground on which was to be fought out
the weirdest and most uncanny of conflicts&mdash;a
duel between two separate selves for absolute
supremacy in the use of the organs of her body.</p>

<p>Further, it soon developed that the advantage
would lie with the secondary self&mdash;which Doctor
Prince called her B self&mdash;because, although her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
ordinary, or A self, suffered from amnesia, or
loss of memory, regarding her actions when in
the B state, the B self had a memory extending
over both states. The mental agony growing out
of this recurring forgetfulness on A&rsquo;s part may
readily be imagined. As the patient herself has
since expressed it, in an autobiographical account
written at Doctor Prince&rsquo;s request:<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The amnesia made life very difficult; indeed,
except for the help you gave me, I think it would
have been impossible, and that I should have
gone truly mad. How can I describe or give any
clear idea of what it is to wake suddenly, as it
were, and not to know the day of the week, the
time of the day, or why one is in a given position?
I would come to myself as A, perhaps on the
street, with no idea of where I had been, or
where I was going; fortunate if I found myself
alone, for if I was carrying on a conversation I
knew nothing of what it had been; fortunate, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
in that case, if I did not contradict something
I had said, for, as B, my attitude toward
all things was quite the opposite of that taken
by A.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Picture to yourself, my reader, how you would
feel if, for a few hours almost every day, and
sometimes for whole days at a stretch, you became
virtually nonexistent, yet were made to
realize, from what your friends told you, that a
something or a somebody had taken possession
of your organism, and was veritably acting in
your place, and in a way utterly unlike your
natural self. This was the state of affairs with
Doctor Prince&rsquo;s luckless patient. In moods,
tastes, points of view, habits of thought, and
controlling ideas, her secondary personality was
the very reverse of that which had been dominant
when she first sought medical advice.</p>

<p>There even were pronounced physical differences.
Whenever she was in the A state, she
was extremely neurasthenic, being afflicted now
by one, now by another, of the multifarious
functional disturbances that accompany neurasthenia,
and being exhausted by the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
effort. A walk of a few hundred yards would be
almost enough to prostrate her.</p>

<p>In the B state, on the contrary, she did not
know the meaning of the word &ldquo;pain,&rdquo; and was
seemingly incapable of feeling fatigue. She
would walk for miles without experiencing the
slightest distress, was constantly on the go, and
appeared to be in every way an exceptionally
robust, healthy woman. Thus, physically, she
was&mdash;as B&mdash;a decided improvement over herself
as A. But with respect to psychical differences
it was altogether another matter.</p>

<p>In the A state, she was kind, considerate of
others, self-sacrificing, animated by a keen sense
of, and devotion to, duty; profoundly stirred by
any tale of sorrow or suffering, and most conscientious&mdash;if
anything, overconscientious, being
tortured at times in an extraordinary degree by
moral doubts. In the B state, she was selfish,
thoughtless, and cold; one might almost say devoid
of human feeling. Here is the way she
herself has put it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As B, I felt no emotion, except that of pleasure,
using the word pleasure as meaning a &lsquo;good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
time&rsquo;&mdash;social gayety, driving, motoring, walking,
boating, etc.; but my enjoyment of these
things was very keen. As B, I was always the
gayest of the company, but for people I cared
nothing. The little acts of affection which we all
perform in daily home life I never thought of.
The habit of shaking hands with one&rsquo;s friends,
kissing or embracing those nearer and dearer,
had no meaning to me. Ordinarily, I think,
when one shakes hands with a friend, one feels
the individuality of the person, more or less, and
the clasp of hands means something; but, as B,
it meant no more to me than clasping a piece
of wood, and the acts of shaking hands, embracing,
or kissing were all alike&mdash;it made no difference
to me which I did&mdash;one meant just as much as
the other. This lack of feeling applied only to
people, for I loved the outside world; the trees,
the water, the sky, and the wind seemed to be
a very part of myself. But the emotions by
which as A I was torn to shreds, as B I did not
feel at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In still further contrast, this most remarkable
young woman, when in the B state, was giddy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
irresponsible, and frivolous. In the A state,
she was most serious-minded and intellectual,
being fond of reading such excellent literature as
the works of Shakespeare, Hugo, Ibsen, Tolstoi,
and Maeterlinck. All this, B found very tiresome,
and cared only for the lightest kind of fiction, when
she read at all.</p>

<p>In matters of dress and social pleasures, A
and B were also diametrically opposed. A believed
that she ought to wear black; B, who seems
never to have given a thought to the dead husband,
detested black, and, on the other hand, had
a really abnormal liking for white. So that, as
the two selves alternated in control, the strange
spectacle was presented of the same woman at
one moment arrayed in deep mourning, at another
dressed in some light, bright gown.</p>

<p>To cap the climax, B took a malicious pleasure
in tormenting her other self in many ways. She
made engagements which she knew that, as A,
she would not like to keep; she cultivated friendships
with people with whom, as A, she had little
desire to associate; she was wastefully extravagant,
freely spending on useless articles money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
which, as A, she had been carefully hoarding
against a rainy day; she indulged in innumerable
petty, but annoying, practical jokes at A&rsquo;s expense.</p>

<p>For example: A would often wake in the
morning to find on her pillow or dressing-table
notes advising her jeeringly to &ldquo;cheer up,&rdquo; to
&ldquo;weep no more,&rdquo; and not to &ldquo;bother Doctor
Prince so much.&rdquo; These notes she herself had
written during the night, having changed to the
B state while she slept, awakened as B, risen,
and penned the notes, and then returned to bed,
to fall asleep once more, and, in the morning,
awake as A, with no memory of what she had
done since retiring.</p>

<p>The flood of notes continuing, she began to
destroy them unread, hoping that this would
discourage B&rsquo;s malicious activity. It only made
matters worse, for B now began to affix the notes
to the center of her mirror, pasting above them
inscriptions warning her to be sure to read them,
and declaring that they contained&mdash;as they
sometimes did&mdash;information of importance to
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>But the best idea of the topsyturvy, kaleidoscopic,
almost incredible life led by this woman
with a double existence may be given by quoting
a few extracts from a diary kept jointly by the
two personalities, at Doctor Prince&rsquo;s suggestion.
Unique as a record of human experiences, it had
a distinctly practical value, for it enabled A
to keep track of what she had been doing while B
was in control. B, of course, had no need of it
for this purpose, since, as was said, she did not
suffer from loss of memory, like A. The extracts
quoted are not always in chronological order;
but, for the present purpose, that is unimportant:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here again to-night, B, I am. I may as
well tell all I have done, I suppose. For one
thing, I had a facial massage&mdash;there is no need
of being a mass of wrinkles. I know A doesn&rsquo;t
care how she looks, but I do. The Q&rsquo;s spent the
evening here, and I smoked a cigarette. Now, A,
don&rsquo;t go and tell Doctor Prince; you don&rsquo;t have
to tell him everything&mdash;you do it, though. I
<em>must</em> have a little fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have struggled through another day. B<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
has told what she did. How <em>can</em> I bear it? How
explain? I am so humiliated, so ashamed. Why
should I do things which so mortify my pride?
Quite ill all day. I am, as usual, paying for B&rsquo;s
&lsquo;fun.&rsquo; It is not to be borne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A terrible day&mdash;one of the worst for a long
time. I <em>cannot</em> live this way; it is not to be
expected. I am so confused. I have lost so
much time now that I can&rsquo;t seem to catch up.
What is the end to be? What will become of
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A was used up, and had to stay in bed all
the morning, but I came about one o&rsquo;clock,
and Mrs. X asked me to motor down to Z. Had
a gorgeous ride, and got home at seven, nearly
famished, for A had eaten nothing all day&mdash;she
lives on coffee and somnos&mdash;nice combination!&mdash;steak
and French fried for mine,
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! How we fly around! A
has been ill all the day, could not sleep last night.
I hope he [Doctor Prince] won&rsquo;t send for us, for
he will put a quietus on me, and, as things are
now, I am gaining on A. Had a gay evening&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
discussions of religion or psychology, no dissecting
of hearts and souls while I am in the
flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if A is really dead&mdash;for good and
all? It seems like it. The thought rather
frightens me some way, as if I had lost my balance
wheel. She wants to die, she really does,
for she thinks it to herself all the time. I wish I
were myself alone, and neither A nor B; I cannot
bear to hear A groan, she cannot bear my
glee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a day! A got away from me for a little
while, and tried to write a letter to Doctor Prince.
It was a funny-looking letter, for I kept saying to
her: &lsquo;You cannot write, you cannot move your
hand,&rsquo; but she had enough will power to write
some, and direct it. The effort used her up,
however, and I came, and the letter was not
mailed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am too much bewildered to write. I have
succeeded in writing Doctor Prince. If I can
only mail it! Oh, but I am tired! Such an awful
struggle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another queer thing happened to-day. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
have not been to the cemetery for a long time,
so started to go there. I had gone only a little
way when I began to feel that I could not go on.
I do not mean that I did not wish to, but that I
could not easily move my feet in that direction.
It was as if some physical force was restraining
me, or like walking against a heavy wind. I
kept on, however, and finally reached the entrance;
but farther I found it impossible to go.
I was <em>held</em>&mdash;could not move my feet one inch
in that direction. I set my will, and said to myself:
&lsquo;I <em>will</em> go, I <em>can</em> go, and I will!&rsquo; But I
could not do it. I began to feel very tired&mdash;exhausted&mdash;and
turned back. As soon as I
turned away, I had no trouble in walking, but
I was very tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These last paragraphs refer to a phase of the
case which was, from the standpoint both of the
patient and Doctor Prince, one of its most serious
and mysterious features. Although B, try as she
might&mdash;and she undoubtedly tried hard enough&mdash;could
not permanently oust the A self, and
had to be content with manifesting as an
alternating personality, it was none the less the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that, even when A was uppermost, B was able
to exercise, from some subconscious region, a
certain amount of influence, often impelling A
to do things contrary to her inclinations.</p>

<p>The consequence was that A suffered fearfully
from what seemed to be aboulia, or paralysis of
will, somewhat similar to that experienced by
Doctor Pierre Janet&rsquo;s patient, Marcelle, described
in the preceding chapter. The cemetery
episode was only one of many incidents, when,
overpowered by some force she could not understand,
and which was actually the superior will
of B, she was unable to carry out projects she
wished to execute, or was made to perform acts
not at all to her liking.</p>

<p>The diary is full of allusions to this subconscious
mastery of A by B. Scores of times, B
influenced her to read some particular book she&mdash;B&mdash;wished
to read, or to go out for a walk
when she&mdash;A&mdash;wished to remain at home.
Naturally A began to consider herself changeable
and weak-minded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; B writes, &ldquo;it was raining and
she did not want to go out, but I felt that I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
not stay in the house another minute. So I
willed that she should go to walk, and she changed
her clothes and went out. She thought: &lsquo;What
nonsense this is to go out in this rain! I wish
I knew what I wanted to do five minutes at a
time.&rsquo; She would think: &lsquo;I guess I will go to
walk.&rsquo; And then she would think: &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t
want to go out in all this rain.&rsquo; Then, in a few
minutes: &lsquo;I believe I <em>will</em> go to walk,&rsquo; etc. And
finally she went, more for peace of mind than
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frequently, moreover, the subconscious willing
to affect A&rsquo;s conduct, resulted in completely
effacing A, and allowing B to reëmerge spontaneously,
in full control.</p>

<p>Thus, there was a dinner party which B was
anxious to attend, but while A was dressing she&mdash;A&mdash;decided
she would not go, and started
across the room to telephone and say she would
not be present. At once B subconsciously began
to think: &ldquo;I want to go,&rdquo; &ldquo;You must go.&rdquo;
And poor A first became very much confused,
then faded away entirely, with the result that
the telephone message was not sent, and B was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
free to attend the party, and enjoy another of
the &ldquo;good times&rdquo; that meant so much to
her.</p>

<p>Where A suffered most of all by reason of this
subtle power of B to influence her actions, lay
in the difficulty she had in communicating with
Doctor Prince, and in going to him for treatment.
B well knew that her career would come to an
end the moment Doctor Prince succeeded in reassociating
his patient&rsquo;s disintegrated personality,
and she fought desperately to preserve her existence,
repeatedly preventing A, as mentioned
in the extracts quoted from the diary, from telephoning
to Doctor Prince, writing to him, or
visiting him; all of which greatly increased A&rsquo;s
confusion, misery, and unhappiness.</p>

<p>But, as it chanced, although Doctor Prince
was earnestly desirous of effectually and forever
suppressing B, he was not at all desirous of doing
this for A&rsquo;s sake; and was, in fact, as anxious
to get rid of A as he was to get rid of B.</p>

<p>For, to inject a new complication into this
most complicated affair, he had by this time
discovered that A had no more right to consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
than B, since A no more than B represented
the patient&rsquo;s normal personality. His searching
study of the case&mdash;the duel between A and B
lasted a year or more&mdash;had convinced him that
there had been not a single, but a double, dissociation
of personality; and that the normal self,
in consequence first of the shock occasioned by
the husband&rsquo;s illness and death, and afterward
of the shock that brought the B personality to
the fore, had been violently relegated to some
obscure department of the patient&rsquo;s subconsciousness,
where, however, it assuredly was existent,
and where it was an intensely interested, if helpless,
spectator of the struggle being waged for
control by the two usurping selves.</p>

<p>To recall this lost self, which he designated as
C, was Doctor Prince&rsquo;s paramount object; and,
after many months of weary and futile effort, he
ultimately succeeded. One day, after he had
plunged his patient into deep hypnosis, he saw
that she had undergone a striking change. Physically
she seemed much as in the B state, though
not so boisterously vigorous; mentally she was
like A, thoughtful and intellectual, but happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
devoid of the vacillation and morbid overconscientiousness
that had made A&rsquo;s life a misery to
herself, and most difficult to all who came in
contact with her.</p>

<p>Questioned, she showed that in this new state
she possessed a complete memory for both the
A and the B states, and was closer to normal
than either. In Doctor Prince&rsquo;s mind, no
doubt remained&mdash;he had found C, the missing
self, the self which, after nearly two years of
exile, had promise of coming once more into its
own.</p>

<p>It had yet to be reëstablished in sovereignty&mdash;no
easy task, as the event proved. Not many
hours after its first emergence, B once more put
in an appearance, wrathful, vehement, and defiant,
angrily challenging Doctor Prince to suppress
it if he could. Then came A, and soon a
momentary return of C, quickly put to flight,
however, by the still powerful will of B. In
short, the conflict now became triangular, with
B and C active opponents, and A a participant
because she could not help herself.</p>

<p>The invaluable diary affords a clear view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the chaos that prevailed, and of the increasing
effectiveness of Doctor Prince&rsquo;s vigorous reënforcement,
by hypnotic suggestion, of the
claims of C. We find, for instance, B lamenting,
after several days&rsquo; banishment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, once more I am permitted to write in
this diary. After we got home, C went to pieces.
I never saw such a lot! And then poor old A
came again, in anguish, wringing of hands, finally
tears. Then, thank goodness, I came myself!
I <em>cannot</em> see why Doctor Prince would rather
have that <em>emotional</em>, <em>hysterical</em> set than to have
<em>me</em>! It passes comprehension. I know <em>everything</em>,
<em>always</em>, and they know only a few things
for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The note of woe and panic sounded here was
amply justified. Little by little, A and B became
less in evidence, until at length they were heard
from no more, and C&mdash;the normal self&mdash;was
left dominant, with a complete restoration to
physical as well as mental health.</p>

<p>But, the reader may well ask, what does all
this mean? Can there really be more than one
self, one personality, in human beings? If so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
what are we? What is the true nature of man?
These are questions that cannot be avoided, and
in my next and closing chapter I will make some
attempt to answer them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="f8">THE LARGER SELF</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> is barely fifty years since the problem of
supreme interest to mankind&mdash;the problem
of the nature, possibilities, and destiny of man&mdash;began
to be studied in a really scientific way;
yet in that half century more progress has been
made toward its solution than in all the previous
thousands of years that have elapsed since man
first asked himself: What am I? What are my
capabilities? Shall I be, after I have ceased to
exist here on earth?</p>

<p>Armed with instruments of the most delicate
precision, devising novel methods for exploring
the body and the mind in their mutual ramifications,
modern investigators have thrown a flood
of new and largely unexpected light on the great
questions at issue, and have opened vistas of
hope and aspiration and actual achievement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
undreamed of by the vanished peoples of bygone
times.</p>

<p>At first sight, to be sure, much of their effort
appears to be irreparably, even wantonly, destructive,
and perhaps nowhere more so than in
the blows they have dealt at the traditional
conception of the central fact in man&rsquo;s psychical
make-up&mdash;that intangible entity variously known
as the ego, the self, the personality, animated
and governed by an indwelling, unifying principle,
the soul. Every man instinctively believes
that there is only one of him. He feels that, no
matter how his thoughts, his sensations, his
emotions may change in the course of time, he
himself will remain essentially and permanently
the same. Putting this belief into metaphysical
language, he declares, with the excellent Thomas
Reid:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The conviction which every man has of his
identity ... needs no aid of philosophy to
strengthen it; and no philosophy can weaken it
without first producing some degree of insanity.... The
identity of a person is a perfect identity;
wherever it is real it admits of no degrees; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
it is impossible that a person should be in part
the same and in part different, because a person
is a monad, and is not divisible into parts.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>But the modern explorer of the nature of man,
replies:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wrong, my friend. Your self is very
far from being the simple, stable unity that you
imagine it to be. In reality it is most complex
and most unstable, easily breaking up, and sometimes
breaking up so completely that it may even
be replaced by an entirely new self. You do not
believe this? I can prove it to you from the
facts not only of scientific experiment, but also
of everyday observation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally, in support of this statement, stress
would be laid on instances resembling the strange
case of BCA, just narrated. And although cases
at all similar to the BCA affair are extremely uncommon
there are a number on record evidencing
in other ways so-called &ldquo;total dissociation of
personality.&rdquo; For example:</p>

<p>A prosperous Philadelphia plumber, a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
exemplary habits and seemingly in good health,
left his home one day to take a short walk. From
that moment he disappeared as completely as
though the earth had opened and swallowed him.
There was no reason why he should abscond or
commit suicide, and the general belief was that
he had met with foul play. Rewards were offered,
and detectives employed, but no trace of him
could be found. His wife, giving him up for
dead, sold his business and removed with their
children to Chicago.</p>

<p>Nearly two years later, the workmen in a tin-shop
in a Southern city were startled one morning
by the conduct of one of their number, who,
dropping his tools and pressing his hand to his
head in a bewildered way, sprang to his feet, and
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! Where am I? How did I get
here? This isn&rsquo;t my shop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The foreman, thinking he was drunk, or had
gone insane, ran forward to pacify him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady, Smith, steady!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other only stared at him wildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me Smith?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name you&rsquo;ve gone by since you
came among us six months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six months ago! You&rsquo;re crazy, man. It
isn&rsquo;t half an hour since I left my wife and little
ones to get a breath of fresh air before dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the foreman, pressing him
gently into a seat, &ldquo;where do you suppose you
are, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, in Philadelphia, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed the Philadelphia plumber, whose
missing self had returned to him as suddenly and
as mysteriously as it had vanished. A few days
more and he was happily reunited with the
family that had so long believed him to be among
the dead.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Where, it may well be asked, was this man&rsquo;s
original self during these two years? What had
become of his normal ego, the ego of which alone
he had formerly been aware? Yet at no time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
throughout the period when he lacked knowledge
of his identity, and was without memory for his
earlier life and social relationships, did he display
the slightest sign of mental aberration. He was
as sane and real to himself and to those with
whom he came into contact, and was as able to
take care of himself and earn a sufficient living,
as he had ever been in the years before he experienced
the remarkable psychical upheaval
that had substituted an alien, a &ldquo;secondary&rdquo;
self in the place of the self he had always been
and known.</p>

<p>A blow, an illness, a fright, the stress of a prolonged
emotion&mdash;any one of several causes may
bring about this weird condition, of which I could
give illustrative cases to a number that would
fill many pages of this book.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Sometimes, though
fortunately seldom, there may be&mdash;as in the
case of BCA&mdash;a double or even a multiple dissociation,
resulting in the development of two,
three, four, or more secondary selves, which
alternate with one another in a way productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of the most intense mental agony to the helpless
victim.</p>

<p>But, after all, it is not necessary to insist on
such extreme instances in order to demonstrate
the essential instability and divisibility of that
which we commonly have in mind when we speak
of the &ldquo;self.&rdquo; Dissociation of personality is in
evidence every day in the pathetic symptomatology
of the various insanities, and in the chronic,
if often masked and unrecognized, memory lapses
universal among sufferers from the manifold
affections of hysteria, such as we dealt with in
the chapter on &ldquo;Dissociation and Disease.&rdquo; It
is in evidence in the victims of alcoholic and drug
excesses, who, in a very literal sense, may become
&ldquo;another person,&rdquo; and say and do things
quite alien from their usual self, and concerning
which their usual self afterward has no knowledge.</p>

<p>Even normal sleep, albeit a wise provision
for the rest and strengthening of the organism,
involves dissociation. Still more strikingly is
dissociation evident in the phenomena of the
state of artificial sleep induced by hypnotism.</p>

<p>It would carry us too far from the point now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
under consideration to enter here into any discussion
of the nature and mechanism of hypnotism,
that still widely misunderstood but marvelous
agency, not simply for therapeutic purposes
but for the study and exploration of man&rsquo;s
inmost being. The thing of immediate importance
is the fact that under the influence of
hypnotism a person invariably develops a self
more or less different from his ordinary waking,
conscious self.</p>

<p>Hypnotized, he is to all outward seeming
oblivious to everything transpiring around him.
But let the hypnotist speak to him, question
him, and he instantly responds with answers so
intelligent as to indicate that, in some respects,
at all events, he is more alert and keen than when
wide awake. Curiously enough, however, commands
and suggestions given to him are, within
certain limitations, accepted and acted upon,
no matter how disagreeable or absurd they may
be.</p>

<p>Later, when awakened, he is in precisely the
same position as are victims of spontaneous dissociation&mdash;such
as the Philadelphia plumber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and Doctor Prince&rsquo;s puzzling neurasthene, BCA.
That is to say, he is unable to give any account
of what he has said and done during hypnosis.
Thus the effect of hypnotism is to produce a
psychical cleavage so profound as to involve
the action, within a single organism, of two
separate selves.</p>

<p>This has been demonstrated by a long line of
scientific investigators, including physicians and
psychologists of international reputation. Moreover,
these investigators have shown that, even
after a person has been brought out of the hypnotic
state, the self evoked by hypnotism may in
some inscrutable way continue operant without
his suspecting for a moment its existence and
influence.</p>

<p>Impressive proof of this is found in the execution
of what are known as post-hypnotic commands.
A hypnotized person is told that, after
being de-hypnotized, he is to perform a certain
act on receiving a certain signal, or at the expiration
of a certain time. As usual, when restored
to his conscious, waking state, he remembers
nothing of the command imposed on him; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
when the signal is given, or the appointed
time arrives, he feels an irresistible, and to
him inexplicable, impulse to carry out the suggested
idea.</p>

<p>Thus, in one series of fifty-five experiments
made by the foremost English authority on
hypnotism, Doctor J. Milne Bramwell, the subject,
a young woman of nineteen, was ordered
to perform a specified act at the end of a varying
number of minutes, ranging from three hundred
to more than twenty thousand. Not once, on
being de-hypnotized, did she remember what she
had been told to do, although offered a liberal
reward if she could recall the commands given
her.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, only two of the fifty-five experiments
were complete failures, while in forty-five
she executed the commands at exactly the moment
designated, and in the remainder was at no
time more than five minutes out of the way. As
to the complete failures, Doctor Bramwell ascertained
that in one instance she had mistaken
the suggestion given, and in the other the circumstances
were such that the command might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
have been executed without his being aware
of it.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Equally astonishing results are reported by
the brilliant group of Frenchmen who, uniting
under the direction of Doctor A.&nbsp;A. Liébeault,
were the first to make an organized investigation
of the cause and effects, the possibilities and
limitations, of hypnotism. One of these French
investigators, Doctor Hippolyte Bernheim, once
hypnotized an old soldier, and asked him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what day in the first week of October
will you be at liberty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Doctor Bernheim, &ldquo;on that day
you will pay a visit to Doctor Liébeault; you
will find in his office the president of the republic,
who will present you with a medal and a pension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldier was then awakened and questioned
as to what had been said to him, but could remember
nothing. However, on Wednesday, October 3,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Doctor Liébeault wrote to Doctor Bernheim:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your soldier has just called at my house. He
walked to my bookcase, and made a respectful
salute; then I heard him utter the words: &lsquo;Your
excellency!&rsquo; Soon he held out his right hand,
and said: &lsquo;Thanks, your excellency.&rsquo; I asked
him to whom he was speaking. &lsquo;Why, to the
president of the republic.&rsquo; He turned again to
the bookcase and saluted, then went away.
The witnesses to the scene naturally asked me
what that madman was doing. I answered that
he was not mad, but as reasonable as they or I,
only another person was acting in him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Compare with this an amusing little story told
by Doctor Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wishing to test the compelling influence of
post-hypnotic commands,&rdquo; he says,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> &ldquo;I suggested
to one of my subjects, Mrs. R., after she
was hypnotized, that on the following day, when
she went down to dinner, she would put on her
bonnet, and keep it on during the whole of dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
time. The next day I received a letter from her
in which she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think I am getting insane. At dinner time
I would wear my hat during the meal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On further inquiry, I obtained the following
story, which I give substantially in the original
language:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As I was going in to dinner, my girl asked
me what I was going out for. &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; says
I. &ldquo;I am going to eat my dinner.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then
what have you got your hat on for?&rdquo; says she. I
put my hand to my head, and there was my
bonnet. &ldquo;Lord, Mamie!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;am I going
crazy?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;you often
do foolish things.&rdquo; I began to get frightened,
but took off my bonnet and went into the next
room to dinner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the younger child similarly asked her
where she was going, and called attention to
her having her bonnet on. A second time she
raised her hand to her head, and to her surprise
found that her bonnet was really there. She
again took it off, and later, when her husband
entered, the same thing was repeated; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
she found her bonnet on her head for the third
time, she made excuse of the stormy words that
ensued to declare she would &lsquo;keep it on now till
she was through.&rsquo; After dinner, being alarmed,
she consulted a neighbor about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the longest time on record for the carrying
out of a post-hypnotic suggestion was made by
a subject of Doctor Liégeois, another of the early
French investigators. Doctor Liégeois hypnotized
a young man, and said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A year from to-day this is what you are going
to do, and what you are going to see: You will
call at Doctor Liébeault&rsquo;s office in the morning,
and tell him that you have come to thank him
and Doctor Liégeois for all they have done to
improve your health. While you are talking to
him, you will see enter the room a dog with a
monkey riding on its back. They will perform
a thousand tricks that will amuse you very much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will see a man come in, leading a
great American grizzly bear, which will also
perform tricks. It will be a tame bear, so that
you will not be at all frightened. The man will
be delighted at recovering his trained dog and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
monkey, which he thought he had lost. Before
he leaves you will borrow a few cents from Doctor
Liébeault to give to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Liégeois, after repeating these complicated
and absurd directions, awoke the young
man, and by cautious questioning ascertained
that his memory was a perfect blank for all that
had been said to him while he was hypnotized.
Great care was taken not to recall to his mind
at any time the command given to him, and which
his hypnotic self was expected to remember and
perform on the appointed day.</p>

<p>Exactly a year later, at nine in the morning,
Doctor Liégeois went to Doctor Liébeault&rsquo;s
office, where he waited half an hour, and then
returned home, thinking that the experiment had
failed. But at ten minutes to ten the young man
arrived. There was nothing about his appearance
to indicate that he was in any abnormal
condition.</p>

<p>He greeted Doctor Liébeault, explained that he
had come to thank him for his kindness to him,
and inquired for Doctor Liégeois, whom he said
he had expected to find there. A few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
afterward, Doctor Liégeois having meanwhile
been hastily summoned, the young man cried
out that a monkey had just come in, riding on
the back of a dog. He watched the antics of these
imaginary animals with great interest, laughing
heartily, and describing the tricks he fancied he
saw them performing. After this, he announced
the arrival of a man who was evidently the owner
of the monkey and the dog, and he begged Doctor
Liébeault to lend him a little money to reward
the man for the amusement his animals had
given him. But he saw no bear.</p>

<p>A moment later he was conversing with the
two physicians, in evident ignorance of all that
he had just been saying and doing. He angrily
denied that there had been any animals in the
room. When asked why he himself was there,
he could give no definite reply. Doctor Liégeois
immediately put him into the hypnotic state, and
demanded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know why you came here this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you told me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A year ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not come at nine o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not tell me to come at nine o&rsquo;clock.
You said to come at exactly a year from the
time you were talking to me. It was ten minutes
to ten when you gave me your command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did you not see the bear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you said nothing about a bear when
you repeated your orders. You spoke only once
of a bear. Everything else you spoke of twice.
I thought you had changed your mind about the
bear.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Obviously, the hypnotic self, distinct and
different though it is from the primary, waking
self, can reason, can analyze, can draw conclusions
as readily as the conscious self, and is, to put
it otherwise, as truly a self as the conscious self.</p>

<p>Facts like these, as was said, have caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
numerous investigators to question the validity
of the hitherto prevailing view of human personality.
The self, they affirm, is no single, continuous,
permanent entity. On the contrary, it
is merely a loosely coördinated aggregation of
mental states, forever shifting and changing, so
that the self of to-morrow may be vastly different
from the self of to-day. To quote Professor
Ribot, the famous scientist, and one of the most
distinguished exponents of this new view of the
self:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The unity of the ego is not the unity of a
single entity diffusing itself among multiple
phenomena; it is the coördination of a certain
number of states perpetually renascent, and
having for their sole, common basis the vague
feeling of the body. This unity does not diffuse
itself downward, but is aggregated by ascent
from below; it is not an initial, but a terminal
point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Ribot adds emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the organism, with the brain, its supreme
representative, which constitutes the real personality;
comprising in itself the remains of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
that we have been and the possibilities of all
that we shall be. The whole individual character
is there inscribed, with its active and passive
aptitudes, its sympathies and antipathies, its
genius, its talent or its stupidity, its virtues and
its vices, its torpor or its activity.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Or, as the eminent psychologist, Alfred Binet,
declares:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have long been accustomed by habits of
speech, fictions of law, and also by the results
of introspection, to consider each person as
constituting an indivisible unity. Actual researches
utterly modify this current notion. It
seems to be well proven nowadays that if the
unity of the ego be real, a quite different definition
should be applied to it. It is not a single entity;
for, if it were, one could not understand how in
certain circumstances some patients, by exaggerating
a phenomenon which obviously belongs
to normal life, can unfold several different personalities.
A thing that can be divided must
consist of several parts. Should a personality be
able to become double or triple, this would be
proof that it is compound, a grouping of, and a
resultant from, several elements.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>But the brain, which Ribot identifies with the
personality, is a mere organ of the body, perishing
with the body. Does it follow that the self
perishes with bodily death? Is it really without
an abiding, indwelling principle superior to,
and independent of, the physical organism&mdash;in
short, a soul&mdash;that would enable it to survive
the final catastrophe of earthly existence? Is
man soulless? Does death end personality?</p>

<p>Aye, those who hold with Ribot would reply.
To speak of a soul is, in their view of the case,
sheer mysticism, since &ldquo;the ego in us is nothing
more than the functional result of the arrangement
for the time being of the molecules or ions of our
brain matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is why, at the beginning of this chapter,
I stated that, of all the labors of the modern
investigators of the nature of man, none would
seem to be so irreparably destructive as the blows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
they have dealt at the traditional conception
of human personality.</p>

<p>Yet, when we probe a little deeper, it will be
found that the damage is not so irreparable as
would at first appear; nay, it will even be found
that by their searching inquiries, the advocates
of the brain-stuff theory have unwittingly provided
stronger reasons than were at any previous
time available for insisting both on the actuality
of the soul and the fundamental unity and continuity
of the ego.</p>

<p>Undeniably, it is necessary to modify the old
conception in some important respects. After
the discoveries that have been made as to the
disintegrating effects of natural and artificially
induced sleep, of disease, of sudden frights, of
profound emotional shocks, of alcohol and drugs,
etc., it is idle to pretend that unity and continuity
are distinctive characteristics of the ordinary
self of waking life. So far as that self is concerned,
its instability and divisibility are now plainly
evident.</p>

<p>What, however, if it can be shown that, equally
with the secondary selves that may and so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
do replace it, the primary self is only part of a
larger self&mdash;a self which persists unchanged
beneath all the mutations of spontaneous and
experimental occurrence? In that case it will at
once become clear that the situation has again
changed completely, and that we are back to the
traditional, the intuitive, the &ldquo;common-sense&rdquo;
conception of personality, with the single difference
that the term &ldquo;self&rdquo; means something
broader and nobler than when we limit it to the
now demonstrated unstable, and ever-changeable
self of ordinary consciousness.</p>

<p>And it is precisely to such a view of the self
that the discoveries of the modern investigators,
when closely scrutinized, irresistibly impel us.
If, I repeat, they have shown that what we usually
look upon as the self is liable to sudden extinction,
they have likewise brought to light abundant
evidence to prove that there is none the less an
abiding self, a self not dominated by but dominating
the organism, and unaffected by any vicissitudes
that may befall the organism.</p>

<p>To be sure, it must be said that, as yet, comparatively
few of those to whom we owe this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
evidence are prepared to admit that such is the
ultimate outcome of their efforts. All the same,
the evidence is there, not simply justifying, but
rendering logically necessary, the hypothesis of
a continuous, unitary ego, inclusive of, and superior
to, all changing selves of outward manifestation,
and possessing powers thus far little
utilized; but, under certain conditions, utilizable
for our material, intellectual, and moral betterment.</p>

<p>I have, in fact, in the previous chapters presented
much of the evidence supporting this
view.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> All the phenomena of subconscious mental
action&mdash;as variously exhibited in telepathy,
crystal vision, automatic writing and speaking,
the cure of disease by wholly mental means&mdash;point
unmistakably, I am persuaded, to the
existence of a superior self to which the ordinary
self of everyday life stands in much the same
relation as does the secondary self of a hysterical
patient to the ordinary, normal self of a healthy

<p>Not all the faculties of the larger self&mdash;for instance,
the faculty involved in telepathic action&mdash;seem
to be adapted for ready employment here
on earth. Which would argue, of course, for a
future state in which, freed from all hampering
limitations of the body, such faculties will have
full manifestation.</p>

<p>But most assuredly, as the findings of the
psychopathologists indicate plainly, some among
these hidden powers are amply available for use
here and now, and may be so employed as to
enable the self of ordinary consciousness to become
less liable to disintegration, to ward off
and conquer disease, to develop mental attainments
of a high order, to solve life&rsquo;s varying
problems with a sureness and success sadly
lacking to most of us at present.</p>

by a case investigated by Mr. Lowes Dickinson, wherein the
medium, an estimable young lady of his acquaintance, was
seemingly &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of a noblewoman of
the Middle Ages, who described the customs, manners, and
personages of the country in which she claimed to have lived,
in such minute detail and with such accuracy that it seemed
certain this was one case at all events in which survival had
been proved. Ultimately it was discovered that every fact
given by the alleged spirit was contained in a little known historical
novel which the medium had read, but read only once,
when a very small girl. So far as conscious recollection went
she had forgotten all about this book, but subconsciously she
had evidently retained a marvelously exact memory of it.</p>
